The drawing accompanies a fiction piece titled “A Place in the Sunlamp.” A review of the 1940 issue by The Harvard Crimson comments on Turner’s process of illuminating a text: “There are certain obstacles as well as advantages which are peculiar to the short-story-illustrator. Howard Turner, I imagine, in order to produce a satisfactory illustration, must rely as much upon his ability to grasp the situation and circumstances of a story as upon his ability to manipulate a pencil.”","82jpg"
