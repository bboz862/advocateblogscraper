"Notes from 21 South Street: KaylaTV","[19, 24]","11","","<p style=""text-align:left;""><em>On Monday, March 11, Kayla Escobedo held a solo show of her own work</em>, KaylaTV<em>, at </em>The Harvard Monday Gallery. <em>The show was curated by Escobedo alongside Danny Bredar. </em>Notes from 21 South Street<em> is pleased and proud to present a record of this event with thoughts from the artist. </em>The Harvard Monday Gallery<em> is Harvard University’s first and only student-run gallery space, founded in 2012.</em></p>{{91 aligncenter}}{{86 aligncenter}}<p><b></b><b>How was <i>KaylaTV </i>conceived? </b></p><p>The video work is a part of my VES thesis, and the timing was really perfect because <i>The Harvard Monday Gallery</i> was looking to put on more experimental, focused exhibitions, and I really needed a place to experiment with my video work and see how it worked as projections.</p>{{127 aligncenter}}{{169 aligncenter}}<p><span id=""more-846""></span></p><p><b>As a body of work, what kind of problems are being addressed? </b></p><p>The refractions and reflections that occur with the projections work on many different levels. In terms of the overarching themes within the <i>KaylaTV</i> project (which actually extends into the realms of drawing, painting, and photography), the refractions are in dialogue with the multiple iterations of this characterization of the self, <i>Kayla. </i>The different lenses through which you can view this work, including the changes in scale, color saturation, and the disjointing that occurs through projections on objects (such as the projection on the chair), are, for me, a part of the project’s handling of the complex relationship one has with oneself. And on another level, I think that the refractions and reflections and the relationships that are ignited as a result of projections occurring across from each other work in purely a visual and aesthetic sense.</p>{{190 aligncenter}}{{184 aligncenter}}{{42 aligncenter}}<p><b>What was it like to curate your work?</b></p><p>It was really enjoyable. The great thing about these video GIFs is that there’s an almost limitless number of ways to arrange and display them. We had a whole world of possibilities to work with, and through hours and hours of experimenting and playing around with the space and materials, we achieved a very interesting investigation of the work. I was delighted to see so many of the visitors interacting with the work in unexpected ways. I think that was a really successful aspect of the show.</p>{{73 aligncenter}}{{38 aligncenter}}{{18 aligncenter}}<p><b>What freedoms/limitations did you encounter/discover?</b></p><div>
<p>Well, the previous question addressed much of the freedom I felt while undertaking the project. And sure, there were a few limitations with regard to the size of the space, the time we were allotted to prepare, the technology, the lighting, and the amount of hands on deck, but curating the show became more about working with those limitations and discovering what came out of them, and I’m tremendously happy with what did come out of it. For this show especially, I wasn’t interested in just taking videos and projecting them. As I began to install the work, I really started to investigate the space, and I wanted to make things more integrated, meaningful, and intentional with respect to the time, place, and materials, and I feel like everything came together with this show. In the beginning, I just saw this space as the only place available to experiment with, but as it started to take form, the space began to be very important to the work, and I’m very glad that ended up happening.</p>

"Dorothea Lasky: Poetry & the Metaphysical “I”","[24]","11","Zoë Hitzig ’15","{{65 }}<p>“Now I’m in the limelight ‘cause I rhyme tight / Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade,” raps the Notorious B.I.G. on hit track “Juicy” from his debut album <i>Ready to Die. </i>On October 10, poet and scholar Dorothea Lasky traced the pervasive braggadocio of hip hop — epitomized by Biggie Smalls — back to the great poets of the U.S. and Ancient Rome, touching on Catullus, Sylvia Plath, Kanye West, Bernadette Mayer, Horace and Nikki Minaj, among other wordsmiths, along the way. Lasky’s lecture, “Poetry and the Metaphysical ‘I’”, focused on the transcendent speaker that can shed identity and slip into any outfit. Lasky argued that boastfulness is ultimately selflessness, empowering the speaker in order to empower the reader; the speaker becomes universal in order to give the reader greater selfhood. Lasky delivered the lecture as part of the inaugural season of the Bagley Wright Lecture Series on Poetry in the Emerson Chapel, where in a commencement address to the class of 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson urged graduating students to seek a new “teacher … that shall see the world to be a mirror of the soul.”  Lasky’s metaphysical “I” becomes the world that mirrors the reader’s soul, that inspires grit within it vis-à-vis Biggie’s swagger, which becomes generous in “Juicy”’s refrain: “You know very well who you are / Don’t let ‘em hold you down, reach for the stars.”</p><p><span id=""more-1218""></span></p>{{106 }}<p><em>Dorothea Lasky is the author of Thunderbird (2012), Black Life (2010), and AWE (2007), published by WAVE Books.

"Harbor: Boathouse Row","[12]","4","Victoria Baena ’14","{{12 size-full}}<p>There was once a time, in high school, when I thought I might be an athlete. Cleaning out the attic the Christmas Break of my freshman year, I came  across a faded, musty photo of my great-uncle’s rowing team. They were all tall and toned and stared grimly at the camera, gripping their oars, their faces determinedly blank and pupil-less. The introductory meeting for my high school’s novice crew team was held at the boathouse down on Kelly Drive: dozens of similar photos cluttered the walls, sepia against wall-paneled oak. There is a quiet exclusivity to a sport that needs a river: I felt its tug of history and decided to enroll.</p><p>The Schuylkill was our playing field, bordered by the Victorian gables of Boathouse Row that lit up at night like gingerbread houses. Our dock was the second-to-last and closest to the waterfall dam; a line of ropes stretched out just in front to cling onto if we drifted too close. It wasn’t a real harbor—the Schuylkill curved into the Delaware, which turned south before the Atlantic—but it was the point of departure and the place of return for our creaky but sturdy eight.</p><p><span id=""more-774""></span></p><p>When we began morning practices there were days we had to shovel snow off the dock in the dark before we could take out the boat. The fog clung to the water and left dew on our knuckles. As the days became longer, the sun raced us awake, tugging the mist up from the surface. The deep regular beats of each stroke modulated those mornings. No one spoke for the first hour of practice—I kept my eyes on the inward curve of my knees and the swinging braid of the girl in front.</p><p>My hands broke open, bled, and calloused. I was embarrassed  to shake hands. Some days we never made it to the river: we were sent to the steps of the Art Museum to run up and down until we were told to stop. The first few rounds we talked and acted out Rocky; by the end some of us were in tears. I have never been as hungry as I was that semester. As we waited for the bus to take us home we would dig into our backpacks for change, exchanging grubby dimes for soft pretzels from the roadside stand, fifty cents each. Nothing was more perfect than their delicate browned crust, the salt  nestled into the bread like craters.</p><p>Our coach, Steve, was a house painter. He wore overalls to practice and never joined us during runs. The mentality was reliably us against him. All the time and callouses bound us closer together; we began to speak in the first person plural. The river’s seamy legends seeped under our skin and into our origin myth. There was the eight-boat five years before, just out of our memory’s reach, which had dredged up a dead body with their oars. There were the two boys’ team members who had been horsing around until one fell in off the dock, contracted a parasite, and was hospitalized for a month. The stories breathed consequence into our small victories and defeats.</p><p>My parents came to the regattas and mingled under the tents; my dad started to talk about college and recruiting. He didn’t know, and I didn’t yet tell him, that I was already feeling the nostalgia of an ending. By the next year I would throw out my uniform, revert to classes, clubs, and recitals replacing all those hours. If anyone asked if I was athletic I would laugh and shake my head.</p><p>But that year I was trying out lifestyles on the sketchbook of the Schuylkill. I was part of a team whose alignment had to be perfect for us to move at all.  I was six-seat in a boat on a Philadelphia river as cars raced up the highway on both its sides and over its bridges; no matter how fast we went we’d never catch up. They’d be home by now and we’d still be on the river, yanking, tugging, rowing up and down, not really getting anywhere and with nowhere we really had to go.</p>","2013-3-11","[468, 300, 441, 409, 60, 513, 190, 678, 36, 64]"
"The Lyric Essay: Glass","[14]","11","Stephanie Newman \’13","{{102 alignnone}}<p><em>The following lyric essay is an excerpt from a senior thesis in poetry by</em><em> Advocate publisher and poetry board member <a href=""http://www.stephanienewman.net"" target=""_blank"">Stephanie Newman</a> ’13.</em></p><p>I am walking back to my apartment. We are in Budapest. I come upon a man. He is sitting behind many rows of gleaming tall-stemmed crystal glasses. So many different heights. A garden. With his moistened fingertips, from glassrim to rim, he chimes his song. His melody attracts a crowd. Mostly foreigners who were sleeping the night away at hotels on the Danube embankment. Men and women, of uncertain age, dressed in evening clothes, looking at each other and smiling. The man behind the song? He plays his song so casually, evasively, as though no crowd were watching, or rather, perhaps, as though his nonchalance deflects attention. What he is making isn’t quite beautiful—too sprite, too high-pitched—but his offering is sent out into this night with an easy flourish.</p><p>My thought about him gives way to a fascination with the material he so effortlessly maneuvers. No mechanisms of hammers and coils, no curiously curved brass; only the transparent process of physics, only touch turning to sound. What is so oddly breakable about the scene? Imagine the explosion of sound that would erupt from the glasses were the table upturned. The light in each glass would unravel. The onlookers would disperse. The man would drop his heavy hands and search for the fleeting silences in the ruptured song.</p><p><span id=""more-154""></span></p><p>Earlier in the week I visited an abandoned glass factory whose fragments were immersed in silence. The garage door guarding the site faded into the run-down streetscape of Vadász utca. When I rapped on the window, an old man came to meet me in the courtyard. His teeth dirty, his hands wrinkled. I asked him if I had arrived at the Glass House. He squinted, he nodded. He unlocked the memorial room and left me alone to read about the site whose dilapidation eclipsed its fame.</p><p>Seventy-five years ago, the factory molted glass into thousands of sheets. They became the windows of the north’s industrial buildings. Then, having grown gargantuan in size, the Second World War arrived in Budapest and suffocated the factory with its chokehold, paralyzing commerce, barring the factory’s Jewish owner. Carl Lutz, Swiss diplomat, took the glass factory for headquarters—we can still see it, how from the seat of his desk, the strange benevolence blossomed. The diplomat issued thousands of international passports to rescue the Hungarian Jews. Beside circular stamps of Swiss validation, in typeface on discolored paper, the words “Gültig für Aufenthalt” gleamed. When papers were not enough, the Swiss diplomat stowed 2,000 Jewish refugees on factory grounds. Packed into chambers in the factory’s brick basement, the silent brigade of men, women, and children slept, woke, urinated, hungered, shivered, and survived.</p><p>I climb down to the cellar, where the only source of light is a window as long as a ruler. The whole space black save for the sun spearing in through the fingerswidth glass rectangle. How grateful we must have been for that patch of glass… Or perhaps it was frightening, this fragile spot where shelter’s teeming meets an outer world, brute with harsh light, sound. One bullet would have shattered glass, cut through a dozen bodies.</p>{{28}}<p>Back outside, a robin-blue glass awning has been shattered in its frame above ground. I look through the windows of the building. I see three metal ladders, white buckets with brown stains, wires running along the ceiling. The reflections on the glass walls bend over each other: images of pipes and chains touch images of trees. I too entrust my form to the transparent walls of the facility. There I am, my image outlined onto the glass doorway, trapped inside this montage of ruin, construction, misgrowth, trees. Why do I feel generous for donating my shape to this massacre of abandonment, for enlivening the decay with my barely detectable human touch?</p><p>Weeks later, in Berlin, I am led to a monstrous cement building with uniform rows of windows. This had once been a school for girls. When the war comes, the Jewish children are marched to houses of prostitution where they spend their days servicing the battalions. I want to leave. I turn. I catch the brisk pivot of my reflection in the blackened window. My features and mannerisms are lent to this ghost-like being, some young girl with long dark hair, walking, in a delicate bending of time, to the brothel in which she will see out her fate. The encounter is no less a transaction, this one between my body and glass, glass always proving the stronger, taking my image from me, distorting its existence. Who is this unfamiliar figure I am now in its grasp?</p><p>Glass: the power to show me: the power to give me my own form: to take it back: to sketch me into circumstances that never bid me enter. I love these versions of myself, the sacrifice that’s required, the submission to laws of physics, to optical sensitivity. The act ultimately one of concession, the opportunity for light to own my body, to recreate it…</p><p>I remember once meeting a father and son who worked together in their underground studio on Morano blowing glass flowers. One would spin the metal rod with liquid glass on its end until the searing material ballooned. And then, under expert flicks of wrist, the balloon would deflate, the rim scallop, the glass blossom solidify. The finished orchids and irises filled an upstairs room with sparkling clusters. I passed through it once, looking to admire the small creations, but all I could see were ruined splinters of myself, cast out in a thousand prisms to make the garden built of crystal.</p><p>By <a href=""http://www.stephanienewman.net"" target=""_blank"">Stephanie Newman</a> ’13.</p>","2012-11-5","[311, 459, 553, 560, 126, 47, 409, 683, 681, 481, 462, 155, 730]"
"On Translating Vergil","[16, 10]","11","Erik Fredericksen ’12","{{61 alignnone}}<p style=""text-align:left;"">Taken together, the first five lines of Vergil’s <i>Eclogues</i> are the most beautiful lines of poetry in the Latin language. It seems people don’t make claims like that very often anymore and, sometimes, I think that’s a shame.</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Why is it that translators are so often driven to attempt precisely those passages that seem so perfect in their original language, so untranslatable? Perhaps it is because translation feels most necessary when it is most impossible.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><span id=""more-240""></span></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I could say that I am drawn to translating these lines because they deal with the same issues facing a translator: the speaker, a herdsman named Meliboeus, is leaving his native land (and taking his song with him), while Tityrus creates an echo of his own voice, spreading his song at the risk of distortion. And it must be the image of the forest. As a translator of Walter Benjamin writes:</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">“Unlike a work of literature, translation finds itself not in the center of the language forest but on the outside facing the wooded ridge; it calls into it without entering, aiming at the single spot where the echo is able to give, in its own language, the reverberation of the work.”</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">So I send my translation to the woods, hoping that its echo picks up some Vergilian timbres along the way. It’s found some dactyls, at least.</p><p><strong>Vergil’s <em>Eclogues</em><em> (1.1-5)</em></strong></p><p>Tityrus, you lying back underneath the shade of a beech tree<br/>
spreading open, on a thin stalk of grass you try the song of the forest.<br/>
I go beyond the ends of my fatherland, leave these sweet fields<br/>
behind—I flee from my fatherland; you, Tityrus, calm in the shadow,<br/>
teach the forests to echo <i>Amaryllis is beautiful.</i></p><p><i>Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi<br/>

"Fever: Cape Trib","[7]","2","Patrick Lauppe \’13","<p>The clouds wear the last pinks of a fallen sun. I’m reclined on a gusty, deserted beach, letting prickles of numbness build up in my arms.</p><p>It’s my last evening up on the top of Australia, and I’m a frightened child. Everything can kill you here. I heard talk of a plant that can lodge its stinger in you and cause constant pain for years. Crocodiles skulk like serpentine abominations in medieval paintings. A row of dense bush behind me seems keen to muffle screams.</p><p>It’s gorgeous, though: a perfect cove, lightly pitched so the water strays up high and forms thin, silvery pools. Plus, it’s my last night in Cape Tribulation before returning to Cairns, and, from there, Sydney. The rugged individualist within who has pushed me this high on the continent picks me up from the sand for one final wander into a mangrove grove in the last light.</p><p><span id=""more-388""></span></p><p>Mangroves are giant gnarled fists clenching the sand, and for several minutes I’m tangled in their knuckles. Then I’m through. A celestial plane of still seawater warps smoothly around my shoes. Floating driftwood reptiles laze nearby, but with a sweep of the eyes I’m consoled. This is a scene that steps me back so that I watch myself watch it. There’s something eternal about this beach; it’s embossed with the glow and fade of endless days. I am nothing but timely crud.</p><p>Suddenly, the lowness of the light has got me worried. The wind is bitter. I shiver in the tropical paradise. I gaze along the bush and realize I’ve wandered far. There is a wide parabola of beach to cover, gripped at the vertex by mangroves. And then there’s the short bush walk to the car.</p><p>I begin walking urgently, so that the thin pools splash up in protest. The water keeps me from running. It’s dark enough now that the driftwood specks wriggle with lack of definition. I wonder what a crocodile sounds like.</p><p>I reach the mangroves, now a nightmarish thicket of slippery limbs. It looks like tangled souls in a Doré print of Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>. I remember gazing at one as a kid, unable to focus on anything, to grasp anything but excess, convolution, nakedness: a mess of members. Now I am forced to traverse the living grove in the hellish half-light. I emerge muddy and mishandled. Dark has fallen, so I begin to run.</p><p>Running across sand is like running in a dream. I feel the urge to fall on all fours, lash at the sand and slither, anything to propel me forward but this horrible, tethered striving. Crocodiles have mastered sand-bound locomotion, lubricated missile of torso sliding along as deceptively powerful frog legs thrash in concert at the ground. I kick up clouds of dust and stutter forward.</p><p>The stars are out, and I realize I’ve come too far. I leer at the bush before me but see no outlet. There’s a parking lot somewhere within all this bush. My car’s there. These are the two tenets that stand between me and hysteria. They are backed by an unassailable truth: I arrived here somehow. But then where is the path?</p><p>I double back, now cursing aloud and periodically emitting a breathy whine that scares me. The bush in this direction is just as solid. Then an opening yawns before me. I squint into the black and step down a small ridge. There’s mud under my feet that I don’t remember. Something makes a small tinkling. I realize there’s a deathly still swamp at my feet, a few shades blacker than what surrounds it. I leap back across the ridge and run, convinced there’s something abysmal behind me.</p><p>Surrounding me now is the prospect of dying alone and nowhere. It takes days to be missed out here; information travels slowly, in discrete, limited jumps. I could spend the entire night searching the bush for the path as crocodiles slip soundlessly out of the water to feed. I pluck up the courage to make one last methodical pass of the bush before despairing.</p><p>The waves rush, and the trees hiss. Strange insects chide the night. I pant, squint, and wave a service-less cell phone like a madman. Eventually the shaft of a jellyfish warning sign glints in the bluish light. I’ve found the path.</p><p>As soon as I sit in the driver’s seat of the rental car, I begin the process of trivializing my fear. Obviously I’ve reached the car, so obviously there has been nothing to be afraid of. This is the attitude I assume every time I recount the story: it all worked out, no worries. For better or worse, fear is only legible from the inside out. From the outside, it’s only so much noise.</p>","2012-11-28","[542, 105, 444, 560, 165, 318]"
"Hospitable Implosions: “Collisions” meets “Motel”","[16]","11","Liza Batkin ’15","{{9}}<p>In the spring issue of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> are two features, <a href=""http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/motel"" target=""_blank"">“Motel” by Georgina Parfitt</a> and <a href=""http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/content/collisions"" target=""_blank"">“Collisions” by My Ngoc Toc</a>, whose titular pairing is irresistible. What kinds of collisions spawn a motel? Destroy one? What kinds of collisions occur daily within?</p><p>Parfitt describes three days spent in and around a buttery-yellow Rest Inn Motel; Toc riffs on the event of collision, which she approaches, avoids, and actualizes in a variety of contexts. Reading the two features in tandem brought me to mind of a contemporary phenomenon and an artistic representation thereof: the implosion of old hotels to make way for new (prevalent, until recently, in Las Vegas), and Richard Artschwager’s <i>Destruction</i> series, which depicts the implosion of the Traymor Hotel. The collision in question is bipartite: the violent meeting of future and past, and the deathly embrace of dynamite and architecture.</p><p><span id=""more-970""></span></p><p style=""text-align:center;""><i>Historical Hotels</i></p><p>Under the National Trust for Historical Preservation, <i>Historical Hotels of America</i> recognizes and advertises hotels throughout the country for their commitment to preserving the past. Their members make claims to having housed the likes of Katherine Hepburn, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and combatants in the Civil War. The Beekman Arms and Delamater Inn of Rhinebeck, New York, prides itself on being the oldest hotel in America, allegedly founded in the early 1700s by William Traphagen, when the town was known by its Dutch inhabitants as “Ryn Beck.” It is rumored that George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Benedict Arnold slept, drank, and waxed revolutionary there. A Rhinebeck native, I proudly echo the Beekman’s insistence on superlatively historical roots, and some cursory research has assured me that, while other hotels do make claims to the same (as I feared), th’ol Beekman always falls somewhere in the ranks of oldest. To preserve landmark hotels is to sustain the memories made under their roofs. Someone important, we convince ourselves, breathed this air, tread these floorboards, grazed these walls with blessed sleeves. By inhabiting their old haunts, we grow nearer to our dead icons; we share a place in common. Unlike the physical luxuries of hot tubs and plush beds, which coax us into expensive solipsism, knowledge of a hotel’s history breaks down its walls, extending present into past and realizing present as the past for a future to come.</p><p>Yet not all hotels share this drive to preserve.</p><p><i>Enter collision number one:</i> <b>Future meets past.</b></p><p><i>And collision number two</i>:<b> Dynamite meets architecture.</b></p><p>As Toc puts it: “one object travels at such feverish high speed, and is so much more massive, that it will devour the other.”</p><p style=""text-align:center;""><i>Dunes’ Doom</i></p><p>In contrast to the <i>Historical Hotels of America</i>, there exists another philosophy of success in the hospitality industry: one that erases the past and looks to the future, erodes the old and flaunts the new.</p><p>Equipped with the slogan “The Miracle in the Desert” and an Arabian Nights aesthetic, the Dunes hotel in Las Vegas thrived for forty years before its life-span was cut short by antsy profiteers. Built in 1955, the hotel saw many an acclaimed entertainer loiter in its lobby, among them Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, and the Minsky’s Follies. By the 90s, however, its revenue had fallen as it couldn’t compete with the shinier resorts that had sprung up since its midcentury heyday. In October, 1992, it was purchased by Steve Wynn. In 1993, the Dunes hotel, Miracle in the Desert, was imploded by six hundred pounds of dynamite. Or rather, “exploded” by a pirate ship from Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, as the spectacle was staged to appear. The 1.6 billion dollar Bellagio resort sprung upward from its ashes.</p><p>In the fifteen years following the demise of the Dunes, twelve other Vegas hotels were demolished in like fashion—the cycle of implosion and construction a regenerative process perfectly suited for a city allergic to decay (might I say <a href=""http://theadvocateblog.net/2013/04/05/symposium-boredom/"" target=""_blank"">boredom</a>) and addicted to marvel. The old made room for the new. From dust to dust, or something like that.</p><p>Most implosions attracted large audiences, and that of the Landmark resort was made explicitly cinematic by its appearance in the film <i>Mars Attacks!.</i> While I would expect as much from spectacle-hungry Vegas-goers, I, personally, would find it hard to abstract the wonder of a collapsing building from events that have attached themselves to images of the same. In my opinion, the demolition of the Desert Inn’s Augusta Tower, for instance, is too reminiscent of that of the Twin Towers to engender applause. In the midst of violence and intentional destruction, I think the least we can do is preserve what we have.</p><p style=""text-align:center;""><i>A Celotex Conclusion</i></p><p>I’d like to conclude with what got me started: a tableau entitled<i> Destruction IV</i>, which was on display at Artschwager’s Whitney retrospective last summer.<i> </i>Painted with acrylic on the characteristically Artschwagerian Celotex, it depicts the demolition of Atlantic City’s Traymore Hotel in 1972, carried out despite campaigns for its preservation. Mediated first by a newspaper photograph, and then by the fibrous Celotex, the painting both distances and slows the explosion. In grainy black and white, the crumbling demands not cheers but meditation. We are forced to pause and knit together shades of grey to realize its totality.</p><p><i>Destruction IV</i> preserves the past by recording its destruction for the future to witness. It slows down our “feverish high speed” by demanding stillness and careful observation. It de-glorifies demolition by presenting it unexplained, leaving for the viewer all the associations that the explosion is apt to provoke.</p><p>The painting is rendered even more powerful by what directly followed its display: Artschwager passed away just a week after the closing of the show that commemorated his life’s work. Unbeknownst to the Whitney, it, like Artschwager, was recording a life on the precipice of death.</p><p>Parfitt’s feature goes some way in painting an alternative to destruction’s false sense of regeneration: allowing the future to stretch out before us, and the past to be revisited. As she describes, “The sun enters in ribbons. I fall back asleep.

Outside, the runways have gotten all nostalgic with the sunset.</p><p>There’s a delay, but I don’t know what it’s for. I keep following the pattern in the carpet: <i>X</i>s on a green base, the green lacking just enough blue to miss turquoise. I’ve been here a lot. These <i>X</i>s are stuck in me: I can’t imagine an airport without them now.</p><p>I’m trying to convince myself of something.</p><p><span id=""more-1090""></span></p><p>I said goodbye to my mother an hour ago, my sisters an hour before that. I was only here for a little while. I’m going back to work tomorrow in San Francisco. A few weeks left before school.</p><p>The <i>X</i>s are mesmerizing.</p><p>Something isn’t right. I don’t feel well.</p><p>*</p><p>Coming back into SF is smooth. I like it here at night. Even in the summer it’s fogged and cold. Two guys smoke cigarettes off the corner of the BART station at 16<sup>th</sup> and Mission, and the smell is comforting. Even late on the street, door-grates still slide open from the apartments.</p><p>Nothing feels real here, at night. Drift through it. It might be raining, it’s hard to tell.</p><p>I’m into my apartment. Lights up. My room has no decorations on the yellow walls, just a bed with rumpled sheets. This place is empty. I won’t be in it for long, like I said. Get ready for bed and turn off the lights.</p><p>Even though I didn’t expect to, I care about someone here. A boy I met at work, Sebastian. He’s more of a stereotypical programmer than I am. I asked him once about an awning on a building, and he told me he didn’t know what that word meant. “Awning.” He says he doesn’t use words to communicate like I do. He just types hard, banging on his keyboard (Dvorak, not Qwerty layout), and software comes.</p><p>Sometimes we’re the same, though. A little contrary. With a habit of not giving a fuck about things, a habit of giving too much of a fuck about other things. He quit last week. We don’t work together any more.</p><p>Sebastian is enough to make me want to stay here, in the city. The work itself isn’t good enough though. It’s fine, it’s useful, it’s instructive, but not enough.</p><p>This is the problem. I don’t want to stay, and I also don’t want to go back to Cambridge now or in two weeks or anytime soon. I have enough money saved up that I can go away for a while; have a part-time job that I can do long-distance. For some God-only-knows reason, here in the dark in my apartment trying to fall asleep I feel it in waves, the need to move. Something pushes outward.</p><p>*</p><p>“I’d miss you, but that shouldn’t stop you. You might never get to do this again.” I’m Skyping with a friend. It’s exactly the right thing for her to say. I turn away and try to make it easier.</p><p>I haven’t felt not-lonely, here or at school, only sometimes busy enough to forget. I wasn’t made for other people. But now I’m afraid to leave.</p><p>Fight off an outburst: that the only fucking reason I haven’t peaced out already is you, that you’re why I’m still in my skin after all this. That’s not right either — too emotional. Over the top.</p><p>Just nod. “I don’t know how to do this.” So choose.</p><p>*</p><p>This is terrifying. Walk by the moon through Dolores and I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m not happy, I wasn’t happy, I want to be somewhere else, somewhere old, where the age in the buildings can give me a little more steadiness, somewhere hard and different with people I don’t know, just a green place that doesn’t feel as comforting as a pill. I romanticize it.</p><p>I can see most of the city from the top of this hill, plus palm fronds in the lower part. They’re just figures in the dark. A train car rumbles when it comes by. Then quiet. No one nearby. On top of the city with it all stretched out in front, something expands. Same as in the airport with the <i>X</i>s like sunspots in my eyes. Just a feeling, starting in the core of my stomach and seeking out.</p><p>There isn’t anything keeping me. There also isn’t anything that I’ll find over there.</p><p>Only the empty place, a box with green-near-turquoise carpet on the bottom, hollow and fragile, where I can walk for a few hours. Stare down, make something and then forget. Count the <i>X</i>s. Become silhouetted. Darken, turn away, leave it undone and abstract.

"E Unibus Pluram: Reading David Foster Wallace through Walt Whitman","[24, 16]","11","Zoë Hitzig ’15","{{116 alignnone size-full}}<p><i>D.T. Max joined critic and Harvard professor James Wood to discuss David Foster Wallace in an event co-hosted by the Advocate and the Mahindra Humanities Center earlier this month. See <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsbKT50ud04"">footage</a> from the evening </i><i>or read a <a href=""http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/wordpress/?p=14135"">recap</a> of the event by former Fiction Editor Patrick Lauppe ‘13.</i></p><p>“The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it,” Walt Whitman concluded in his now-treasured preface to the first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. I recalled this conclusion while reading <i>Every Love Story is a Ghost Story, </i>D.T. Max’s new biography of David Foster Wallace. Though Whitman and Wallace seem to occupy distant intervals on the writerly gamut, to me Max’s biography portrayed Wallace as an exemplar of Whitman’s “proof of a poet” statement. Through the biography, the reader absorbs Wallace’s life page by page, and in turn the pages illustrate ways his readers—the nation—slowly soaked into him. Whitman likely did not intend and could not have foreseen such a relationship: Whitman came to epitomize “e pluribus unum” (one from many), while Wallace repurposed our nation’s de facto motto into “e unibus pluram” (many from one).  Wallace aimed to pick up the splinters of the American psyche that had been united, then fractured, in the years since Whitman. The story of how Wallace arrived at his ultimate failure, <i>The Pale King</i>, can be substituted as “the proof of a poet” where the novel itself failed.</p><p>In the preface to <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, Whitman was responding to the paradigms set forth by Ralph Waldo Emerson, in “The Poet,” an essay published eleven years earlier. In that essay Emerson expressed the nation’s need for a visionary who would both articulate and embody the grace and grandeur of America and her people.  But Whitman’s preface was more than a response to Emerson—it was a solution. It served as his statement of intent: to epitomize the qualities Emerson had described, becoming “The Poet” Emerson had so lucidly summoned. A resounding voice of the nation, Whitman met Emerson’s expectations along the way to fulfilling his own. For Whitman, “absorbing” the nation affectionately was a matter of becoming the nation. It is this ethos that engendered “Song of Myself,” which, as the heart of his poetic project, is perhaps the closest we have to an American epic. “I am large, I contain multitudes,” Whitman as narrator declares; “I act as the tongue of you.”</p><p>But this self-as-whole, individual-as-universal notion is only one of many ways to read Whitman’s “proof of the poet” dictum. Throughout Wallace’s biography, D.T. Max allows readers to celebrate Wallace’s life, comprehending the complex writer with newfound affection regardless of whether they have read his work. In turn, the biography describes Wallace’s monumental dedication to his readers, and the ambitious final project undertaken in the name of his readers: the project that ultimately became his demise. These reciprocal processes, though they take place outside the immediate realm of the author’s work, form the mutual “absorption” Whitman’s dictum required.</p><p>The absorption would not be possible if Max had not distinguished the author of <i>The Pale King</i> from the writer who came before, showing how Wallace’s final years were arguably his most insightful. In those years he was more stable than he had ever been, in a functional marriage and in a rewarding teaching position. But the ambition of his final novel loomed large. In his head, his novel was years overdue. In writing <i>The</i> <i>Pale King, </i>Wallace was solidifying answers to all the questions with which he had grappled since the beginning of his career—regarding the novel’s many ambitions, Max writes, “It had to show people a way to insulate themselves from the toxic freneticism of American life. It had to be emotionally engaged and morally sound, and to dramatize boredom without being too entertaining.”</p><p>Emerson contended in “The Poet” that all poetry “was written before time was,” and that in attempting to write, most will miswrite the truth. Wallace, with his colloquial style that newly captured the fragmented experience of late-20<sup>th</sup>-century American life in <i>Infinite Jest</i>, is one of Emerson’s “men of more delicate ear [who] write down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations.” But the Wallace who wrote <i>The</i> <i>Pale King</i> was unwilling to concede to imperfection, unwilling to publish the cosmic pulses he intuited until all their points of inflection had been precisely located.</p><p>Although sentences of Whitman’s preface and Emerson’s essay may describe Wallace, Wallace’s image hardly aligns with their transcendentalist visions of the great American bard. But the Wallace of <i>The Pale King </i>ought to. Wallace was characterized by inconsistency—his Midwestern sincerity and straightforwardness seemed at odds with his verbose and elliptical writing style, and yet his motives for <i>The Pale King</i> might reconcile the irregularities. Max hinted at this conflict when detailing the ambitions of <i>The Pale King</i>, noting that the novel “had to sidestep the point that the kind of personality that conferred grace was the opposite of Wallace’s own.” The story of Wallace’s ultimate battle becomes a powerful stand-in for his failed novel’s ambitions, and it shows us the many ways in which his personality, in all its contradictions, is the <i>only</i> kind that might confer grace upon his readers today. Max writes, that <i>The Pale King </i>“was [Wallace’s] effort to show the world what it was to be ‘a fucking human being.’”  Where his final effort foundered, his story might nearly succeed.</p><div>

"Introduction: Moonshine","[14, 13]","5","Noah Pisner ’14","<div></div>{{5}}<p>Here they come: three stone-faced bootleggers with their shirts tucked into their coveralls driving Chevys out of the laurel to sell moonshine in bottles in the pavilion parking lot. Here they come: the three of them now finished with their breakfast, their stomachs full of biscuits and gravy and kraut. <i>Here they come</i>, my friend says. He tells me they come here often.</p><p>We’re seven miles from the highway. It’s just past dawn. Some farm kids are out running dogs. The first bootlegger jabs the air with his index finger: <i>No-no-no, it’s the special pussy, man, way back in the back</i>. Which part of a truck bed is the back? I lift the tarpaulin further along and my friend quickly moves for a different set of jars — is he guessing? The second bootlegger heaves back with his kitchen table drawl: <i>Boss uh-huh boss</i>. I guess he’s not guessing. The third bootlegger, an Iraq vet, explains he’s been drinking hooch since his mother first tried to get rid of him in utero by chugging two quarts of it.</p><p>They ask my friend and I if we’ve ever drunk moonshine before. I lie.</p><p><span id=""more-990""></span></p><p>That great grains have for a long time been illegally distilled in these parts of Virginia is manifest — literally everybody makes their own grain liquor here, including the preacher. Winos stir it in their coffee. Mothers put it in their children’s eggs so they don’t get so runny. Larger batches double as an effective cleaning agent.</p><p>The Feds hate all of it. It costs them millions. In schools here children learn that moonshine laws are holdovers from the Prohibition and, before that, Hamilton’s whisky tax. <i>Ferment away</i>, they say. But you have to pay $13.50 a gallon if you want to distill.</p><p><i>What a lark</i>, mocks the first bootlegger. It’s such an easy rule to skirt.</p><p>I once overheard a woman shopkeeper at a nearby gas station advising a passing traveler on how to make proper shine: ferment fifty percent sugar and fifty percent corn then distill until its ripe enough to gas your car twenty miles. No aging needed, but maybe add a hedge of damson berry for flavor. Or if you want something with a more florally taste you can use barley instead of corn. Rye is spicy and big.</p><p>If it’s clean as lime, your drink will carry you around all day long.</p><p>The first bootlegger says <i>c’mere </i>and pulls my friend and me aside all buddy-buddy. He’s an honest-to-god outlaw and good salesman. <i>First off</i>, he says, <i>if it’s legal moonshine, it’s probably just some Everclear knockoff for the snoops up in the North</i>.<i> </i>You’re not going to get your money’s worth. <i>You also got to avoid the rotgut crap</i>. That’s that heavily sugared brew that makes amateur stillers go blind and die — pure methanol made in old car radiators — <i>the crap</i> he says our moms probably warned us about. I want his stuff because it’s private stock. He puts his hand on my shoulder: <i>Pure corn liquor is always private stock.</i></p><p><i>Look</i>, my friend says, shaking a jar in his hands.<i> No head.</i></p><p>It’s hard not to romanticize. The two of us come to this part of the state for camping and the baby-blue swimming holes on Hyco River. That evening we sip the liquid from brown jugs and cook biscuit dough over a pine-bough campfire. Embers fly like beetles and fall onto dirt. We rub them into the ground with our shoes.</p><p><i>This is the life</i>, my friend says, <i>and the South is very old</i>.</p><p>It is very old. I readjust my seat.</p><p>Good moonshine comes at you like a bowie knife: point first, dulling your senses the deeper and deeper it goes. It’s like walking backwards. You step back away from something, say, a river. Your vision gets lost in the river — the carp and the mud. Then the river gets lost in the hills, the hills in the mountains, and the mountains in the sky. The sky grows wider, the mountains flatter. Somewhere in the center is still the river, of course, but you can’t be bothered to recall where.</p><p>For a minute you might even forget your toes.</p><p>We’ve all been drunk, but 160-proof grain liquor is a different kind of play. It only takes a few ounces for even the meanest backwoods drinkers, men who knock back a pint or more a day for forty years, to feel it whop down in their skulls, as if something scooped out the brain matter and poured in napalm. Some say it’s downright evil. <i>Twenty bucks a gallon</i>, the second one had told us. Our cotton shirts are soaked from the summer heat. Or is it because of the fire? The radio mutters words in a language we don’t understand. The dough is done. Someone blows on a harp.</p><p>My father never drank moonshine, nor his father or grandfather, which means I’m the first man in my family in at least three generations to touch the stuff. Shakespeare probably never drank moonshine either — whisky perhaps. Still, the guy gets credit for popularizing the name — <i>moonshine.</i></p><p>In Act V of <i>The Tempest</i>, Prospero soliloquizes one last time: <i>You demi-puppets that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make</i> (V.i.38-39). He describes the great feats of magic he has performed in his life but that he will do no more, including harking the planets from the sky and planting toadstools by moonlight. I like to think of moonshiners as the old Prospero’s acolytes — disenfranchised magicians spurned for their nighttime tricks, grump devils cast down. Incidentally, the soliloquy marks the end of Shakespeare’s solo writing career.</p><p>We’re used to hearing the drunkard’s story — the drunkard who grabs onto your arm and pants, <i>I did this and it was so interesting</i>. This next series of posts will come from such inebriates among us — the moon-dogs, the poisoners, the magicians, the smugglers, the lunatics.</p><p>However, it’s better to think of our stories as fiction, for one can never be too wary of the law. Indeed, I never met three bootleggers outside a camping pavilion in the Virginia piedmont. They never sold me six full jars with the affront “XXX” written on them in Sharpie, the old joke.</p><p>Furthermore, I never overheard a woman shopkeeper — the one from the gas station. And as the traveler handed her cash for a 20oz. Pepsi and chips, she never mentioned that years ago the mayor of her county seat, drunk on moonshine, shit on his kitchen table and burned his house to the ground.</p>","2013-7-1","[311, 721, 596, 409, 373, 111, 51, 168, 623]"

He contributed poems to the <em>Harvard Monthly </em>and <a href=""http://theharvardadvocate.com"" target=""_blank""><em>The</em> <em>Harvard Advocate</em></a> (in his own name as well as under the pseudonym of R.

His poetry would not be published again until 1914.</p><p>Stevens’ first book of poetry, <em>Harmonium</em>, was published when he was forty-four; scholars tend to agree that he completed his greatest works relatively late in his career. But Stevens’ three years at 54 Garden Street in Cambridge, Mass. were the setting for his self-conscious cultivation of an artistic identity. His interactions with Harvard professor, philosopher, and poet George Santayana; his membership in the <a href=""http://www.signetsociety.org/"" target=""_blank"">Signet Society</a>, an undergraduate arts and letters society; and his participation in various publications helped to initially shape his poetic consciousness. The tension between reality and the ideal, for example—a theme that would prove central to Stevens’ poetry—is already present in the pieces reproduced here. Encouraged by his father, Stevens would leave Harvard for law instead of art; but these relics prove that as a young man he was already a poet and, perhaps more significantly, thought of himself as one.</p>{{30 alignnone size-large}}<p><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate, <em>Vol. LXVI, No. 10 (March 13, 1899)</em></p>{{126 alignnone size-large}}{{29 alignnone size-large}}<p><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate, <em>Vol. LXIX, No. 5 (May 10, 1900</em>)</p>","2012-11-21","[617, 560, 409, 467, 494, 582, 64, 141]"
"Should You Buy It?: American Innovations by Rivka Galchen","[16, 5]","11","Indiana Seresin, ’15 ","{{40 size-full}}<p><em>American Innovations </em>is a concept book, which makes it a good gift. The person opens the wrapping paper and says, excitedly, “Oh, what’s this?” And you say: “It’s a collection that reimagines famous stories from the perspective of female characters.” And then, to give it a little weight, to prove its not merely a gimmick, you give a quick list of Rivka Galchen’s accomplishments: One novel, <em>Atmospheric Disturbances</em> (2008), excellent reviews; professorship at Columbia; one of the <em>New Yorker’s </em>20 under 40 (2010). <em>Et voila:</em> the gift-receiver is thrilled about their new book.<span id=""more-1434""></span></p><p>Galchen’s realm of exploration in <em>American Innovations</em> is women’s subjectivity, that vast and uncharted planet. In all the stories she plays with—Gogol’s “The Nose,” Bolaño’s “Last Evenings on Earth,” Thurber’s “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” and so on—women do not feature, or feature only as props, supporting actors, background noise. Galchen takes these stories and twists them, relocating them both geographically—mostly to the U.S., and often to Oklahoma, where the author grew up—as well as psychologically, setting them deep within their female narrators’ minds, which are invariably strange and unsettling landscapes. Mental instability and self-delusion are recurring motifs (it will not surprise the reader that Galchen has an M.D. in psychiatry). Indeed, one of the main triggers of this self-delusion is the struggle to appear sane. “I’m a pretty normal woman, maybe even an extremely normal one… A normal, stable adult with an ordinary life,” asserts the narrator of “Once an Empire,” comically unconvincing. Later on in that story, the narrator’s beloved possessions (“I love my things. I have a great capacity for love, I think”) spring to life and parade out of her apartment, never to return.</p><p>Galchen’s protagonists are strange women living in an arguably stranger world. Their relationship with reality is troubled. In the first story, “The Lost Order,” a woman semi-intentionally takes the take-out order of a confused customer who thinks he is calling a restaurant. “I hate my phone,” the narrator grumbles, following the call. “I hate all phones.” Alone in her apartment, she is connected to the outside world and only through her phone, which she grows to despise.</p><p>Weight loss is a common theme. The second sentence of the collection is: “I was trying to eat a little less often, it’s true.” One gets the sense that, like the reader of the stories Galchen references, the women protagonists in <em>American Innovations</em> are used to viewing themselves from the outside. “I would see us from the outside and recognize that I was, in an old-fashioned and maybe even demeaning way, the sidekick, the mascot, the decoration; it was thrilling,” admits the narrator in “The Region of Unlikeness.” Yet often, their reaction to the image of themselves is a desire to make themselves smaller.</p><p>Fittingly, <em>American Innovations </em>is a slim volume, and by the end, the reader might find themselves wishing it was longer. As previously mentioned, it would make, in its current hardback form, an excellent gift; however, those who want it for themselves are advised to consider waiting for the paperback, or trying a library.</p><p> </p>","2014-7-14","[516, 450, 249, 714, 225, 328]"

"Habit: Sleep","[20]","3","Katherine Damm ’13","{{83 aligncenter}}<p>A friend and I diverge in our attitudes about sleep. Ever the pragmatist, the utility of her sleep is a function of what it will allow her to accomplish in her waking hours. After it has served that purpose, its value quickly diminishes, and sleep as a leisure activity is little more than a waste of time. An allocative inefficiency.</p><p>Meanwhile, I think sleep has its own, self-contained merit. Ask a recreational traveler about their hobby, or maybe more accurately ask a coin collector, a wine connoisseur, for a sense of this perspective. Every interval of sleep is different, like every fingerprint. Eight-hour spans that pass like the blink of an eye, so sudden they cut you off mid-thought. Long, lazy naps that leave you feeling sick and heavy. Jagged-edged insomnia like a broken-off branch. Clean sheet sleep.</p><p><span id=""more-924""></span></p><p>And of course, dreams. I know people who paint their dreams. Who, when describing them, get a look like they are re-immersed by the telling. Who are pleased by their mind’s ability to create outlandish and disturbing events without effort or intent. I’m not like that. My dreams are, for the most part, mundane. Occasionally something fantastical will happen, or frightening, and I count myself lucky for those moments. Usually, though, my unconscious mind simply enacts thoughts or conversations I’ve already imagined all day, just with better production value.</p><p>The most unusual dreams I ever had were on Mefloquine, a malaria prophylactic with gentle neuropsychiatric effects. I was in Tanzania for three months, and though the village in which I was based was elevated high enough that mosquitoes were not a problem, I still broke the pill out of its foil and swallowed it with iodine-tinted water once a week. The goofy travel doctor warned me that I might have “visions of demonic sugar-plum fairies,” and I had to hope his example was autobiographical. But I think the medicine just boosted me to the average strangeness of other people’s dreams, peaking on Mondays when I took the pill and tapering to the usual banality as the week progressed.</p><p>The real advantage was that each time I woke up, I could recall dreams, enough to notice that for weeks, all my dreams were of Philadelphia. Can you really say you are in a place when, each night, you go home? Believers say that ghosts are spirits with unfinished business, and I understand the logic embedded in the lore.  I had left home with things unsaid, and I could not stop going back and saying them, and saying them.</p><p>I remember the happiness I felt nearly a month into the trip when I woke up from a nightmare about a lion pawing at the door to the house: the Tanzanian house, not my family home. That is to say, after weeks, I had finally arrived. Though the Philadelphia dreams never completely ceased, in the nights that followed, I started dreaming more of the place where I went to sleep, not the city still two months and seven thousand miles away, which was a relief: it had been exhausting.</p><p><i>Illustration by Kayla Escobedo ’13</i></p>","2013-4-27","[133, 596, 602, 701, 378, 327, 454, 640, 513, 8, 374, 155]"

Squeezed behind these obsolete artifacts was a book, lovingly crumpled from a combination of wear, and, later, of neglect.</p><p><em>882 ½ Answers to Your Questions About the Titanic</em> sustained me through most car rides, long and short, throughout early elementary school. Each section in the book was short and manageable, introducing me to facts about the steerage, and the bow and the stern every time I turned the page. Some passengers brought their dogs on board.  The kitchens were equipped with twenty-five cases of olive oil, and the three hundred cases of shelled walnuts.  Supposedly, thirteen couples traveling were on their honeymoons. Some scholars speculate it would have been safer to hit the iceberg straight on.  All eight members of the ship orchestra lost their lives. I learned that April 15—tax day—was the day the Titanic sank. Engrossed, I didn’t mind the mild nausea I felt as I read in the backseat.</p><p><span id=""more-1428""></span></p><p>While this was one of the few books on the <em>Titanic</em> that I actually owned, the Nautical shelf at the local library replaced ‘Children’s Books’ as my destination of choice. I did own, though, a model of the <em>Titanic</em> that could be submerged in water. When enough water filled the plastic interior, I watched with wide eyes as it would split and then sink. Afterwards, I would let the water drain, and put it back together, for next time.</p><p>Before long, I was rattling off facts about the <em>Lusitania</em>, the passenger ship that was hit by a German U-boat during World War I. On the playground, waiting in line for four-square, I explained to my friends what torpedoes were. Before turning off the light each night, I pored over pictures and skimmed captions about the <em>Andrea Doria</em>, the boat that sank in the 1950s, after colliding with another cruise liner. I still remember thinking how peculiar it was that this ship didn’t sink as dramatically as the Titanic did with its stern sticking up into the night sky. Instead, it sank “horizontally,” rolling over into the depths of the sea.</p><p>2012 marked the hundred-year anniversary of the famous ship’s sinking, which gave those fascinated by the Titanic reason to celebrate.The eponymous movie was also re-released, this time in 3-D, and the love story between Jack and Rose captivated another generation of young adults.</p><p>In theaters, the story, loss, and romance eclipsed the number of workers that built the ship in Belfast, or the fact that the hull of the Titanic of eight hundred and eighty-two and a half feet long, or that only 214 of the <em>Titanic’s</em> 899 crew members survived. The film created its own spectacle, separate from the ship’s historic hype and subsequent tragic voyage. Its fourteen Oscar nominations and haul of eleven of Academy Awards, and budget of $200 million, its star-studded cast of DiCaprio and Winslet shined the brightest. Apparently besides directing, James Cameron himself actually drew all of Jack Dawson’s sketches. The filming largely took place in Baja California, Mexico. The film became the first ever to gross over $1 billion. Triumphant cries of “I’m king of the world,” resounded around the world.</p><p>In the ensuing flurry of media coverage, it became clear that many had failed to realize the connection between the re-release and the anniversary. In candid public tweets, thousands admitted to not realizing that the <em>Titanic</em> was a ship that actually sailed and sank. For them, the <em>Titanic</em> simply was a high-grossing romantic movie and the inspiration for an iconic two-person pose.</p><p>If one casts the right actors and actresses, a fantasy and story will serve as a popular placeholder. The facts on which Hollywood’s unabashed adaptation was based had sunk out of sight, as the real-life tragedy continued to sit solemnly on the ocean floor.</p><p>But the historical event had its own set of facts and figures, in which I took comfort as a child. My favorite book, aptly titled <em>882 ½ <strong>Answers</strong> to Your Questions About the Titanic</em>, seemed to play into this frenzy of information the most. Regardless of how many questions the young reader had, the book always had more answers. The rolodex of information never stopped turning. When we ate dinner, I would remind everyone around the table how much butter was on board the Titanic. I started precociously referring to inanimate objects as “she” or “her.”</p><p>Like the amount of butter, or the maximum speed of these cruise liners, I also could recall with perfect clarity the number of those who perished at sea. These figures became no more than trivia. As an eight year old with soft, flushed cheeks and slipped-on Merrells, I could rattle off the estimated range of those who froze to death, of those who died from complications related to the impact itself. I delivered these facts with a proud smirk.</p><p>As with most obsessions that swell, my fascination and fervor soon waned. I moved on to a new series of phases, diving head first into long division and the gruesome tradition of Roman gladiators fights.</p><p>I still remember that many gladiator helmets were made of bronze.</p>","2014-6-6","[450, 677, 139, 81]"

On her twentieth birthday of that year, she receives three gifts from three friends: a heather plant, a forsythia branch, and a bouquet of daisies and jonquils. As she leaves her teenage years behind, she seems to achieve a hat trick of gifts and “scores” three times.

"Moonshine: “I am on my guard”","[13, 16]","5","Zoë Hitzig ’15","{{77 }}<p style=""text-align:left;"">The architect Tadao Ando once claimed, “Walls manifest a power that borders on the violent.” Ando’s characteristic work both suppresses and celebrates this power; the architect metes thick concrete walls in sharp corners and curved interventions. Ando softens the severity of his geometric lines and reinforced concrete with painstaking attention to the location of the structure. In some works, an unexpected slit in the concrete will bathe an entire wall in sunlight. A cleverly placed window might frame a distant mountain, as though the window were serving as art.  Ando’s austerity, balanced with a delicate treatment of natural light and surrounding landscapes, rarely feels aggressive.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><span id=""more-1021""></span></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">But I once encountered solid walls built by Ando that were intent on sealing off the outside world entirely, and they remain perhaps the most “violent” walls I have ever faced. These walls belonged to a structure called Minamidera, erected to house an installation by James Turrell entitled <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>. Together, the structure and the artwork inside honor a temple that formerly stood at that site on Naoshima, a small fishing-island-turned-contemporary-art-destination off the coast of southern Japan. Inside Minamidera, visitors are instructed to keep silent for 15 minutes, the duration of the experience. Depending on the viewer’s eyesight, the first 5-10 minutes are spent in total darkness, after which, as pupils dilate and dilate, objects appear or seem to appear — I reserve details here to maintain the sanctity of the experience.</p><p>Minamidera embodies a hostile impulse that is amplified in Turrell’s work and suppressed in Ando’s. The hostility hits the viewer upon entry, as the work submerges the viewer in awkward cascading dualities: first light and dark, then fear and pleasure, and finally grace and ungrace. The realization that perception cannot be trusted magnifies into a worry that nothing can be trusted. When I was there, I felt at one moment as though my body could fill the entire room, and at the next as though I stood at the center of a void. Throughout, I felt huge, clumsy, and covered in skin. I heard the elephant speaker in Marianne Moore’s poem “Black Earth.” The speaker, after describing how she enjoys wading into the river where the sun can warm her back, writes,</p><p>This elephant skin</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Which I inhabit, fibered over like the shell of</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">The coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light</p><p> </p><p>Can filter—cut</p><p>Into checkers by rut</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Upon rut of unpreventable experience—</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">It is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the</p><p> </p><p>Hairy toed. Black</p><p>But beautiful, my back</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Is full of the history of power. Of power? What</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">is powerful and what is not?</p><p>In effective blindness I felt violated and yet newly connected to the silent and invisible forces of the cosmos, as if my skin were “a manual.” Perhaps this has something to do with the near-hallucinatory “Ganzfeld effect,” the phenomenon of seeing phantom forms when the eye is exposed to a uniform field, which Turrell employs in many of his works. Inside Minamidera, the blackness, “Black / But beautiful,” takes away sight and replaces it with a more mystical power — “my back is full of the history of power.” But accompanying this sense of power is awkwardness and fear, derived from the uncertainty that the walls might be moving toward each other.  To play along with Turrell’s plan for the viewer, Ando removed light — the softness that usually disguises his aggression — from his structure, creating a powerful sense of doubt as to “What is powerful and what is not?”</p><p>Without sight, the sense of a body in space is inverted. Rather than the body placed in relation to external forces, the body becomes a map for these forces. The Ganzfeld effect takes the movements of the pupils and projects them onto the colorless walls. Moore writes, “through- / Out childhood to the present time, the unity of / Life and death has been expressed by the circumference / Described by my / Trunk; nevertheless, I / Perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after / All; and I am on my guard.” As this heightened awareness of the body as blueprint arises out of deception, the sensation is accompanied with vigilance. Ando’s walls in Minamidera indeed put me “on my guard.”</p>{{62 }}<p>Ando often cites a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Imperial Hotel in Tokyo as inspiration for his pursuit of a career in architecture. With a mammoth work of Turrell’s now occupying the central rotunda in Wright’s most iconic structure, the Guggenheim museum, Ando and Turrell share a most appropriate muse. Turrell’s giant <em>Aten Reign</em> installation in Wright’s open, airy, light-filled dome seems to supplant the restraint of <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> with spectacle. But as the colors of the dome gradually change, viewers consider color with more care and again must reckon with the “indestructibility of matter” and the body. Moore almost perfectly describes <em>Aten Reign</em>, “that / Phenomenon / The above formation” in the same poem,</p><p>Spiritual</p><p>Brother to the coral</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Becomes a nebulous green. The I of each is to</p><p> </p><p>The I of each,</p><p>A kind of fretful speech</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is?</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Black earth preceded by a tendril? It is to that</p><p> </p><p>Phenomenon</p><p>The above formation,</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Translucent like the atmosphere—a cortex merely—</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first</p><p> </p><p>Time, a substance</p><p>Needful as an instance</p><p style=""padding-left:30px;"">Of the indestructibility of matter</p><p>Moore’s elephant speaker watches “equable sapphire light” become a “nebulous green” just as <em>Aten Reign</em>’s viewers watch the saturation of each color intensify and subside. Moore’s speaker attempts to make sense of the subjectivity of perception—“the I of each is to / The I of each, / A kind of fretful speech / Which sets a limit on itself.” This attempt to reason with perception leads into an existential resignation to <i>un</i>reason: “the elephant is?”</p><p>Turrell’s work is driven by this very unreason; he submerges the viewer in dichotomies that resist rationale. While <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> performs this submersion in utter darkness, <em>Aten Reign</em> initiates the cascade of dualities more subtly, in light. Subverting perceptual logic, his light installations ask viewers to embrace the confusion and discomfort of sensory immediacy in order to confront the impossibility of the body. Walls, whether in Ando’s stern concrete or Wright’s startling circlets, demand the same confrontation on a smaller scale. The aggression is well justified, though, for as Moore asks in the closing line of the same poem, “Will / Depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no / Beautiful element of unreason under it?”</p>","2013-8-1","[721, 516, 596, 433, 398, 587, 80, 409, 713, 55, 716, 297, 368, 491, 532]"
"Fever: The South Pacific","[7]","2","Reina Gattuso ’15","<p>That was a winter of fire alarms. Smoke set off the blare one afternoon in mid-February, shrieks bouncing through the halls of my small-town high school as we exited, half-costumed, onto the frozen grass. Our science-teacher-cum-set-designer had decided that burning bamboo poles for our South Pacific set was a good idea. The strobes flashing from the walls when the warning system smelled smoke told him otherwise.</p><p>Something in my father’s heart wasn’t working right. Until that afternoon, we didn’t know it. Even when my mother tried to call me six or seven times to tell me about the ambulance, that tests had found something serious and they were rushing him to the hospital, the fire alarm swallowed up my ringtone’s harsh jangle. I didn’t see the missed calls until after the belching red trucks had pulled away.</p><p><span id=""more-411""></span></p><p>Anyway, I had other things to worry about: my best friend was dating the boy I had liked for all of high school. He was in the pit and she was in the chorus, and they spent the whole afternoon kissing in front of everybody. I was restless hot.</p><p>Musical season did that to me. It had a way of making me push at the boundaries of my small life like they were damp bed sheets twisted around me. The year before I’d played Lola, the sexy part in Damn Yankees, and paced down the hallways for hours trying to make my hips smolder as I walked. I’d performed a strip tease as part of the choreography, sliding gaudy tulle to reveal translucent black tights, booty shorts, a corset. It had been obscenely uncomfortable for my friends’ fathers, and I’d thought the whole thing delicious.</p><p>Opening night sparked several reckonings. My director was called to the principal’s office and my father called the director and the director called me. My father asked why the director always cast me as a hoochie. The principal threatened the director’s job. The director told me to keep my clothes on.</p><p>Apparently the principal had noticed me walking the hallways with a bit too much swing in my hips. It looks like she’s been having sex, the principal said. This concern about my fractured chastity made sense in a place where, rumor had it, the superintendent didn’t accept Muslim exchange students for fear they’d have to pray in the halls. I figured it wouldn’t help to tell my principal that I had read <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves</i> from cover to cover, dog-earing chapters entitled “Masturbation” and “Lovemaking with a Woman,” and had learned that virginity was a construct.</p><p>Everybody’s worries were allayed senior year, then, when <i>South Pacific</i> came around and I was cast as the eccentric old lady. That’s how I was dressed when the fire alarm went off during the third to last dress rehearsal, sending us actors shuffling to wait on the cold pavement, lighting quick cigarettes and wiping wet eyeliner, until the bulge-bellied men gave the all-clear. It was only then that I thought to check my phone. I had twelve messages.</p><p>Daddy was in the hospital. The only reasonable response I could muster was to cook chicken parmesan. I had never made it before, but knew to pound the frozen meat against the counter to thaw it, rubbing it in slimy egg yolk and cooking it in the oven until it was still pink at the bone. My sister ate it crying, the clenched flesh thick, the sauce-laden breading gloppy under her fork. Beneath white layers the muscle was the color of an aorta. Daddy was in the hospital. He had needed to be helicoptered to an even better hospital for surgery. My sister cried over the chicken.</p><p>He came home diminished and dizzy, a scar on his hip. He was boozy from anesthetic. He laughed a raspy laugh. For the next couple days, he enjoyed recounting what things looked like from the inside of the ambulance, the beeping monitors, the placebo white. I had never really thought he’d die—not beyond the first moments of checking those messages, when the very air shivered with dread—but there was something scarily tenuous to the thought of all that rubber going through him. When we talked, as I got ready for school the day of opening night, I heard his voice, its pump of breath and tissue, with a new cast of awe. As we drove past the lower school on our commute that morning, the small building shrieked with the sound of a fire alarm.</p><p>At the cast party a couple of days later, we seniors got wine-heavy and played spin the bottle with wet lips, tongues loose and hungry. For a moment I felt like Lola again, tipsy, a rip in my stockings. The play had gone off without errant stripteases or burnt bamboo accents, and my father had promised to begin going to the gym every day. That night, as the rest of us messily kissed over the sticky coffee table, my best friend and the boy I liked knit their limbs together in the other room. That kind of heart trauma still seemed the most important.</p>","2012-12-10","[542, 560, 165, 147, 648, 464, 564]"

We have endeavored to share online something of the wonder we find within the four walls of the Advocate house: a wonder based as much on collision as it is on intention—those chance meetings, collaborations, and discoveries of new ideas that take place outside the boards’ official mandates. The <i>Advocate</i> this year has been inspired not only by its young and energetic membership but also by the new connections we’ve forged outside the magazine, from our new allies in the digital sphere to the friends we made at our open-to-all January writers’ workshop. To all of these, our heartfelt thanks.</p><p>We hope that you enjoy the <i>Origin</i> supplements on the blog and see them, along with the rest of the work published there, as an effort to share the bustling life of the building with our readers. The historical supplement, which will be released this coming week, was designed with similar intentions.</p><p>At 21 South Street, surrounded by traces from some of America’s greatest writers, it is easy enough to think—with Umberto Eco (or with the Kinks)—that all the stories have already been told. By getting our past off the shelves and into our hands, however, we seek to make our history available for play and variation. Nostalgia has the power to lure us, like Herzog’s Aguirre, towards a false authenticity, and to leave us lethargic thereby. In the production of the <i>Origin</i> issue, our interest has been rather in the expedition itself, because it is there that we see the realest work of imagination.</p><p>Andreas Huyssen writes that remembrance, too, is a pole of utopia. With this in mind, we offer you <i>Origin</i>. After <i>Blueprint</i>, after <i>Fanfare</i>, I like to think of this issue as the long walk back after a night out—towards home, perhaps, or to wherever you end up.</p><p><i>By Alexander Wells ’13, President Emeritus</i></p><p><i>You can view the issue and subscribe to the Harvard Advocate at <a href=""http://www.theharvardadvocate.com"" target=""_blank"">www.theharvardadvocate.com</a>.</i></p>","2013-3-5","[228, 450, 596, 283, 592, 634, 409, 745, 690, 109, 31, 15, 141, 24]"

"TRIAL: A Conversation with Kathryn Davis","[3, 5]","11","","{{181 aligncenter}}<p><i>On February 13, Advocate alumnus and contributor Patrick Lauppe conducted an interview with American novelist Kathryn Davis. An abridged transcript of their conversation appears below. Davis is the author of seven novels, including </i>Duplex<i>, which was published by Graywolf Press in September. You can find “The January Tunnel,” a chapter of her upcoming novel, in the Advocate’s latest issue, </i>TRIAL<i>.</i></p><p><span id=""more-1351""></span></p><p><i></i><strong>The <i>Advocate</i> is publishing a chapter from your next novel. What’s the general scope of the novel, and where will this chapter occur?</strong></p><p>It’s very hard to answer those questions, because the novel is still in process. I’m not writing this novel chronologically, so I am not one hundred percent sure at what point in the book “The January Tunnel” will appear. My guess is it will not be too far from the beginning, because it introduces the sense of walking on a trail of some sort, and that’s the unifying factor, at least at this point, as I know it for the book.</p><p>Last summer I walked a little portion of what most people know as the trail to Santiago de Compostela, which is in Spain. I was walking the part of the trail that runs through France. I had actually started writing the novel in which “The January Tunnel” will appear before going to France. I didn’t think that walking on the trail had anything to do with the book I was writing, but it mysteriously turned out that I had already written a number of aspects of the walk into the book. It was a little spooky. As a result, the central characters in the novel all have in common the fact that they are pilgrim walkers. Like the pilgrims in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, all of the characters are going to be designated by profession.</p><p><strong>Let’s turn to <i>Duplex</i>, your most recent novel. While several of your novels feature fantastical elements, these often prove to be figments of a character’s imagination. In <i>Duplex</i>, however, robots literally live in the suburbs, an actual sorcerer drives around in a shiny car, and mysterious airships called scows fill the skies. What brought about this change?</strong></p><p>The world of <i>Duplex</i> is completely based on the street on which I grew up. On some level, I think it is as realistic as a description of a world can be, according to that sense of it you carry with you as your life moves on.</p><p>What I wanted to replicate was that sense of, “It is just the way it was,” the way that things are presented in a fairy tale. There’s no explanation. If there are robots living on the street, there are robots on the street, and we don’t know how they got there, or why they’re there, or even their psychological implications. They’re just there. That felt absolutely right to me and very true to my version of reality. In the same way, it seemed to me that these people who lived down the street from me, when I thought about it, <i>were </i>robots. It wasn’t that they were <i>like</i> robots, but the only really good explanation for that family was that they were robots.</p><p>That was the way I approached all the information that went into the book. It all presented itself to me in that way. You’re playing outside, it’s getting dark, it’s a summer night, and a car comes down the street. There’s something completely otherworldly about that. That was where I began.</p><p><strong>Where did you grow up, and how did you begin writing fiction?</strong></p><p>I grew up in Philadelphia, and I began writing when I was pretty young. I started out writing poetry. I actually thought I didn’t have the attention span to write something longer, although I was putting lots of things into the poems that I was told didn’t belong there. Back then the taste was for really short lyric poems. I think if I’d been older and had a stronger sense of purpose, I would have told everybody to go to hell and done what I wanted to do, but as it was I ended up taking these things out. As it happened, all the things I was taking out of the poems were precisely the sorts of things a person could put into a piece of fiction. Eventually, it dawned on me that I had always preferred reading fiction, and so I started to write short stories. I had pretty immediate amazing luck publishing a couple of my very earliest stories in <i>Esquire</i> magazine back in the days of Gordon Lish.</p><p>As I kept writing short stories, they got longer. At some point, I realized that what I really wanted to do was write a novel. The very first novel I wrote was horrible, as so many first novels are. I put my novel in a box and hid it somewhere. I don’t even know where it is anymore. When you’re working on a novel, you have this idea that it’s not easy to write one, and that one of the things you have to do is persist through the difficult times. Inevitably, there’s always that moment when you find yourself wondering, “Well, is this an instance of a problem that I have to persist through, or am I just working on a horrible novel that I should just get rid of?”</p><p>I was wondering that with my very first novel, and then one night I had a dream. At that time, I lived out in the middle of the country. In the dream, I was walking out of the house toward the barn, and this horse stuck its head out through the top of the barn door. It was Mr. Ed, the talking horse. He said to me, “It’s borrrring,” and I knew he meant my novel. From that moment on, I put my novel in a box and moved on to the project that became my actual first novel <i>Labrador</i>. That was all because of Mr. Ed.</p><p><b>The link between writing and dreaming is central to <i>Duplex</i>. In the book’s universe, duplex neighbors are able to share dreams due to the proximity of their brains. How do you consider this novel, or perhaps the novel form, as a space where minds can meld?</b></p><p>I’m very interested in the place where a work of literature makes a transition from one place, one thing, one person, one something to another—where there is an implied gap of some sort. Sometimes, this will literally appear as white space on the page. Sometimes, you’re sitting in the car with a character, and then, without any real descriptive transition, you are no longer in the car—rather, you are walking up a hillside three days later. When those kinds of transitions work, you don’t feel jolted or shocked or confused. It makes sense in some weird way that you were here and now you’re there. In between, there’s this place where I think the reader’s mind is working in concert with the writer’s mind in an incredibly strange way. The psyches join, so that the reader has access to something that hasn’t even been put into words.</p><p><b>A middle ground of some kind recurs throughout your work. Sometimes, this middle ground is spatial, like<i> </i>a duplex; sometimes, it’s metaphysical, like the title realm of your 2006 novel <i>The Thin Place</i> in which the living and dead coexist; sometimes, it’s conceptual, like the uncanny. What makes you gravitate toward these uncertain middle zones where distinctions dissolve?</b></p><p>I think I gravitate there for two reasons. One, because that is quite literally the way I experience life in the world. I have always had a very strong sense that things are not quite the way they seem to be. You can pin this easily on the fact that I grew up in a crazy household where the only way you had any hope of knowing what was going on was by reading between the lines, because nobody was actually coming right out and saying anything to explain their behavior. In that way, there’s a nice, solid psychological explanation.</p><p>I also believe that I have a predisposition in that direction. When I was pretty little, some guy from the University of Pennsylvania came to my first-grade classroom, and he was doing some project using these cards to test out extrasensory perception. So, he sat on the other side of this board, and he would hold up a card that had a shape on it, and you were supposed to say what shape he was holding up. I got a perfect score. Accordingly, I have a predisposition for all those realms where things are a little off.</p><p>When I read, I’m always drawn to literature where you don’t know exactly what’s going on. It doesn’t have to be a work of literature where something really weird or wild is happening. For instance, I love reading murder mysteries because you don’t know what’s going on. You know that something has happened, and you’re trying to figure out why or how it happened. I’m just attracted to that mood in a piece of writing. Taking the very good advice to write what you want to read, I think that’s why I write the books I write.</p><p><b>I get the impression from your novels that not only do you want to give the reader this feeling of estrangement and curiosity while reading the novel, but you also want the reader to come away with this feeling when they look back up at the real world. To what extent is this your intention?</b></p><p>In every one of the books I write, I want to create a world that the reader enters into entirely and then finds it difficult to get out of. As a reader, I remember and revisit those books that change the way I see, or the way I feel, or the way I hear. That’s what I want my books to do to readers.</p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’17</em></p>","2014-3-7","[348, 450, 612, 492, 161, 550, 318, 82]"
"The Landscape Imaginary","[19, 24, 16]","11","Camille Coppola ’14.","{{70 alignnone size-full}}<p><em>Mark Bradford, </em>Black Venus<em>, 2005. Berezdivin Collection, Photo: Bruce M. White. Courtesy of <a href=""www.themarkbradfordproject.org"" target=""_blank"" title=""www.themarkbradfordproject.org"">www.themarkbradfordproject.org</a></em></p><p>The Harvard Design School occupies the core of my mental campus map. Inside the efficient Bauhaus structure, I imagine, designers construct precise models for future spaces. They synthesize and restructure theories from around the university, as they fit them into physical frameworks of steel, Plexiglas, and wood.  Unlike most Harvardians, these academics make things. They belong to the real, physical world.</p><p>At first, the recent exhibit at the Design School seemed to confirm this image.  Maps on walls and in display cases rendered spatial indicators—topography or population or climate—in aesthetically pleasing visual codes. Design students’ experiments in cartography shared space with gorgeous, abstract expressionist visions. The exhibition’s title, however, is “Cartographic Grounds: Projecting the Landscape Imaginary”—despite their apparent exactness, the facts and figures portrayed by these maps are fictional.</p><p><span id=""more-226""></span></p><p>A course I’m currently taking, “Stranger Than Fiction” with Carrie Lambert-Beatty, examines contemporary art projects that perform fictions as if they were true, everyday events. We have examined a utopian version of <em>The</em> <i>New York Times</i> dated six months in the future; artists who have assumed alternate personas for large portions of their lives; and museums that have staged excavations of their facilities, revealing the buried artworks of invented actors. All of these projects have gained criticality, or the ability to challenge existing philosophies and social structures, through this fictional strategy. After revealing themselves to be fictions—after shaking off their cloaks carefully stitched into the fabric of the everyday—these projects force us to reevaluate conventional structures and to question our usual perceptions.</p><p>The maps at Harvard’s Design School are not as critical, or at least not in the overtly political sense. Unlike the critical fictional projects, the initial viewing experience of these maps does not seem less legitimate after the project’s “big reveal”: the maps’ subjective schemes for processing a landscape seem to speak more to our experienced interactions with the world than any factually correct graph of data might. These mappings of associated colors and walk patterns suggest the way in which memories and associations color my own interactions with a space. As I leave the exhibition, I’ll reenter campus, processing Cambridge Street with an additional lens of color, or walk pattern, or topographic layer. They also recall the invented interpretive schemes of digital technology in general: these maps are not fictions but rather technologies that inform our everyday experience. Perhaps “fiction” in contemporary art operates increasingly, then, as a function of our digitally influenced and designed environment—and not exclusively as a theoretically produced, political tool. Carrie Lambert-Beatty’s seminal essay on the strategy, “Make-Believe: Parafiction and Plausibility,” does not explicitly argue that these projects predominantly serve activist purposes. But responding theorists like Jose Falconi have suggested its primary function as a challenge to the status quo.</p><p>Artists and architectural designers (however arbitrary a distinction that may be) have increasingly overlapped in method and aim in recent years.  <i>Art Forum</i> published a roundtable in last month’s issue that discussed the architectural concerns of much contemporary art. Olafur Eliasson, for instance, has researched principles of light and physics to produce immersive, architectural environments, and Hilary Lloyd has explored the architecture of film installations[1].  Mixed media “painters” Mark Bradford and Julie Mehretu have produced their own visual languages to signify the contemporary landscape. In their vast and textured versions of regional <em>Google Earth</em> images, and in their complex arrangements of minute, geometric shapes, Mehretu and Bradford encode a contemporary landscape that is, paradoxically, local and global; abstract and representational; actual and virtual. Discussions about the architecture of museums also take place within this larger debate about the role of art today.</p><p>Digitalization has helped to generate this trend—in many ways it can be interpreted as a resurgence of the early twentieth century’s dominant philosophy on art, which saw architecture as the structuring logic of an ideal model of art production. Digitalization inevitably charges architects with artists’ traditional roles: the virtual projections of landscapes at the Design School seem more apt for building environments than any physical structure would be. To build—to ensure successful reception of their environments despite increased levels of mediation between maker and audience—architects must first produce artistic visual schemes. These maps’ visualizations of a space enhance the cognitive maps we habitually use. Though the ribbons of color and figural themes may not challenge the foundations of aesthetic experience, this is not to say that they or similar artistic-architectural works are not political, nor that they lack the potential to be. After nearly a century of confrontational interventions and abrasive shocks to aesthetic experience, maybe this digital age we live in offers new and more pleasurable possibilities for the fusion of art and life. The challenge for these artist-architects would then be to preserve these aesthetics, as they steer their art back towards the process of democratization. For now, these images steer my mental map: absorbing the topographical strata in purple and yellow hues, organizing the shifting sensations into a pattern of lines and dots.</p><div>

"Fever: Stallone in One Take","[7]","2","Alexander Traub \’13","<p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Why does Stallone have to take the offer? Most importantly, he doesn’t have a cent over $106 in the bank. In fact he’s already had to sell his dog, and not even to make a profit. He just couldn’t afford the dog food anymore.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">On the one hand, in 1975 Stallone considers himself lucky to have $106. Five years earlier, when he went broke and got thrown out of his apartment, Stallone slept in the Port Authority Bus Terminal for three weeks. Flipping through job listings on an empty stomach, he saw a casting call for a film called <i>The Party at Kitty and Stud’s</i>. He auditioned and got cast as Stud. After that paycheck Stallone was never homeless again, but he also never forgot that he’d been reduced to small-time porn.</span></p><p><span id=""more-342""></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">On the other hand, United Artists is offering him $20 thousand for his screenplay. Burt Reynolds wants to play the protagonist. Rejecting the offer for Stallone isn’t just saying no to 188 times his present net worth. It’s saying no to his first, maybe only chance to break out of the unremitting failure he’s faced in seven years of writing and acting. In all this time he’s done nothing but try: Stallone’s painted the windows of his apartment black and thrown out his phone to focus better on writing dialogue.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">So Stallone <i>has</i> to take this offer. But that doesn’t mean he actually will. You see, Stallone wrote the lead role for himself. That fighter isn’t just some symbol or movie God. That fighter is Stallone. The character, whoever plays him, is the seed of a celebrity creation myth.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Stallone to the studio execs: I’ll work for free if you cast me. Studio execs say that they can’t cast a nobody. They up the offer to $80 grand.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">No.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Okay, okay, they say that they’re also thinking about casting Redford. If Redford’s interested, they’ll go up to $200 grand.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Redford wants to play the lead. $200 grand.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">No.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Would Stallone take $300?</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">No.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">$330?</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">No.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">$360?</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">No, says Stallone, you’ve got to understand. I would rather throw myself in front of a train than see this movie succeed without me. Stallone’s given birth to this beautiful baby and they can’t buy it from him just to make someone else the father. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Fine. United Artists pays Stallone $340 a week along with $20 grand for the script. After taxes and agent fees, that lump sum goes down to $8 thousand. The budget is so strained that Stallone shoots the boxing scenes all in a single day. The key scene, when Rocky tells Adrian that he’s been a <i>nobody</i> his whole life, that he just needs <i>to go the distance</i> with Creed, is nearly cut. When the studio finally agrees to finance the shoot, Stallone is given just enough money for one take. It’s all he needs.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">The story is its own film, and its underdog looks a lot like Rocky himself. Now when Stallone tells his tale fans and journalists eat it up. It’s the best American cheese they’ll ever find. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">By Alexander Traub ’13</span></p>","2012-11-23","[542, 485, 549, 560, 165, 709, 244]"

"Water in the Andes","[14]","11","Anne Marie Creighton ’14","{{183 size-full}}<p>Six hours from Lima, the eastern Andes are crossed and re-crossed by shepherd’s paths. Two weeks ago, with my Spanish program, I was preparing to go on a two-day hike among them, in the peaks beyond the Tarma Valley. The route we chose runs ten miles up and down the first day, with a manageable return the next morning. I had never done anything like this before.</p><p>The night before, absent real knowledge, I was full of nervous eagerness. I had good reason to be nervous: although the hike would have been manageable in the Appalachians, even though I’m not in shape, this trail was above twelve thousand feet. As I had begun to learn, I don’t do very well at altitude. But we had spent the past day and a half exploring the region, thrilling to the beauty of the mountains, so I was also eager to start. I expected that the next days would be unforgettable, even more gorgeous than what we had seen, and that, if anything, this unaccustomed physical exertion would add vividness to my memories. A shooting star outside seemed to augur well for our endeavors.</p><p><span id=""more-1004""></span></p><p>The next morning, we drove to a valley below the first mountain slope we would ascend. The valley was flat, something more than five hundred yards across, with a little lake at the far end of it. The whole valley was full of water – I had not expected there to be so much water in the Andes. Our path took us around a series of lakes, but I had thought they would be lakes in a dry land. Instead, this valley and others were marshy. Little streams ran everywhere, and the floor of each valley was covered with pans of water just too well-established to be called mere puddles. The mood of the sky changed quickly up there; you could always see it reflected in the valley.</p><p>The Cordillera Negra looming before us, we climbed that first ascent under a gray sky. After making it to the top, we walked a long stretch within the clouds themselves. When we reached a high and unused road, a little after noon, the sun finally came out. The Cordillera Negra caught the clouds as they departed, puffy and no longer ominous in the newly-minted sunshine. The last of the lakes we saw that day, in the late afternoon, was Mamacocha, “Mother of Waters” in Quechua. There was no visible entrance or outlet to the lake, so it was absolutely still between the high gray cliffs surrounding. After that, me needing some help to do so, we climbed a steep zigzag path up to the shepherd’s house where we would spend the night.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, I was already doing badly by the time we made it to the end of the day’s first stretch, at the end of that first flat valley. This was early in our trek, less than a mile from where we had started. Contrary to my expectations that the difficulty would add savor to what I was seeing, my exhaustion argued mostly that I shouldn’t have done this without more preparation. From the plain of that first valley, the humps in the ground, five or eight feet tall, had started to look much taller. From the very first slope, which the experienced members of the group did admit was the hardest we would make that day, I started wondering if I would make it. I didn’t think I would faint, but the possibility crossed my mind more often than I would have liked. My hands started to look further away than they should have. Although water helped and I did better after making it to that top, I never stopped struggling. Putting one foot in front of the other consumed too much energy.</p><p style=""text-align:center;""> ♠</p><p>Some images are preserved in your memory forever, in all their detail, texture, and color. When I remember any of the things I saw that day, when I look at the pictures I managed to take, I feel that these images ought to be among them. They are not. While I do think I will remember the places I saw that day forever, I already see them as if they were sand etched on glass, a paler, more translucent form of memory.</p><p>I remember with utmost vividness the pain in my hands as we walked among the clouds. Earlier, I had sat down too readily on an unfriendly patch of marsh grass, which covered my hands in dozens of translucent spikes like bees’ stingers. Now I needed my hands free to balance, so I could not tuck them into my coat. I don’t remember why I refused to put on my gloves. The mist was cold, and it stung. I remember shaking with cold much later, on the last late ascent, as the temperature started to drop before nightfall. But the rainbow that once flashed below us, say, or the glorious golden light of sunset in the mountains—I already remember these more from pictures than from memory.</p><p>The friends who did it with me talk about this hike as a thing to have accomplished, how much they will remember of everything. I am glad I did it, but I am struck by how indistinct my memories are, of the vagueness of their beauty. This is no less true for the things I saw in the first mile than the things I saw in the ninth; a haze lies over everything. I got more out of it than perhaps I should have expected, given how little I could do at altitude, but aside from four or five images, it is all a beautiful blur.</p><p style=""text-align:center;""> ♣</p><p>I was surprised at how much water there was in the Andes, but clean water was still hard to find. In Peru, as in many places in the world, you shouldn’t drink the tap water. In places like the shepherd’s house where we stayed overnight, there is no tap. They call tea “water,” in the diminutive form, because water is only safe boiled. We were carrying water with us, too, but in the house I was grateful that they gave us tea.</p><p>The shepherd had a son, Renzo, who was three. I reached the house first, so I sat there clutching my hot mug, trying to warm up and to make friends with the kid. When the others arrived, our professor, who spent much of his childhood nearby, poured some water from his bottle into a ceramic bowl. He offered it to Renzo, saying that this was water—he should try it. Renzo took the bowl with cold, purified water, bigger than his head, and sipped from it. He finished that one.

Or do you imagine other people reading them out loud?</p><p>Zoë Hitzig: My default mode is to think about a poem in my voice. But it’s also really important to have the external experience of just listening, rather than listening and reading, or listening and speaking.That’s why I record.</p><p>KH: You have to experience it as being read, so that you’re making sure that you’re pacing the reader in the way that you want it.</p><p>So more along the lines of voice—I think that in this poem, there are a couple of different modes or voices that’s going on, so can you take us through that a little bit?</p><p>ZH: I wrote this in two voices. Like I’m talking to an evil twin, and the evil twin is talking back. I think that who’s evil and who is not is confused throughout the poem.</p><p>KH: So, in lines like <i>“let go please, shadow sister, watch me swear you one wisdom tooth”—</i> then you have a ship metaphor—is there some sort of exchange going on between the two sides? What is this “Commerce” that’s going on?</p><p>ZH: I see this as a battle and bartering between two sides of the self, or a person and her shadow. Or however you might want to say it—a twin with her evil twin? All those different tropes can be imposed onto it. I liked the idea of thinking of the personal, one-to-one stuff as mapping onto the global world. That’s one of the things that I was thinking about—how the global lines of commerce and economy and shipping and mining and production and all of these big macroeconomic dances are mimicked in interpersonal relationships and persona.</p><p>The idea of a Protected Designation of Origin completely fascinates me—you can only say that your product is ouzo if it comes from a very specific region—what a funny idea.</p><p>KH: Do you want to talk about the form a little bit? I’m interested in these long lines, first of all—these lines that are mimetic, in a way—“<i>as further proof that shadows want flesh to buckle slump, stretch horizontal</i>”—there’s a sort of a drunken feel to some of it, and I would love to hear how you created that.</p><p>ZH: I played around with the form a lot, and the main feeling that I wanted to convey was the feeling of a jolty jaunt. Spiraling down a hill. I also have the wheel imagery that comes out in the end—and the gyroscope. I was thinking of how to get that sense of descending, downward motion, with something cyclic, but also not smooth at all. There are some lines that are perfectly iambic, and some that are tough and tricky to read. I definitely played around with the length of the lines—at first I wrote very short lines, which lent themselves to a faster pace. But that didn’t feel enough like an amble— it felt too out of control.</p><p>KH: Does ouzo factor into the shipping idea? The idea of an intoxicant coming from a distant place?</p><p>ZH: Yeah, there’s a lot of intoxication in this poem. One of the things I was thinking about when I was writing the poem was how bizarre it is that ouzo—and other liquors that typically use anise—look like milk when you put water in them. A glass of ouzo or a glass of absinthe on the table can be mistaken for milk?</p><p>KH: Did you ever write under the influence Zoë?</p><p>ZH: What? (laughter). I don’t think I wrote this poem while I was drinking. It was definitely inspired by intoxication and the relationship that you might have with an intoxicated self.</p><p>I was writing this poem in Greece. Interestingly two of the poems that are published in the TRIAL issue are set in the Aegean Sea.</p><p>KH: Matt Krane’s ‘For the Crew Marooned On an Island in the Aegean Sea’. <i>TRIAL</i> is going to be great.</p><p>ZH: This issue will be <i>great</i>.</p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’17</em></p>","2014-2-17","[228, 450, 467, 161, 94, 157, 82, 669]"

"Down the Rabbit Hole","[16]","11","Julian Lucas \’15","<p>As the augurs would have it, literature is not long for this world. Phillip Roth gives the novel twenty five years; others see that as optimistic. Many are too busy reading to have time for these doomsayers, and the greatest portion of all have never cared. Nevertheless, these fears raise a question well worth asking: What would remain of a world without good books?</p><p>Tochtli is the seven-year-old narrator of <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em>, the  debut novella by Juan Pablo Villalobos. He’d be something like Lewis Carroll’s Alice, had Alice grown up in a fortified desert compound near the Santa Teresa of Roberto Bolaño’s <em>2666</em>. For Tochtli is the son of Yolcaut, <em>narcotraficante</em>, chief of the most macho gang for eight kilometers. He plays console games, collects hats and memorizes samurai films. He finds books useless, but reads the dictionary every evening. He wants, more than anything, a liberian pygmy hippopotamus. He’s funny – he has the proverbial babe’s mouth.  Around him and above his childish understanding, his father’s bloody kingdom waxes and wanes, disgorging headless corpses and macabre enigmas. Tochtli sees all of it. “Think the worst,” says Yolcaut, “and you’ll be right.”</p><p><span id=""more-25""></span></p><p><em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> is a spare, arid novel, severely circumscribed in its lexicon and the depth of its characters. Tochtli is the only real character in the book. Yolcaut is a cartoonish gangster. Mazaztin, the tutor – with his tirades about the hegemony of the gringos and his habit of living with Amerindian tribes – is a satirical figure of the Latin American radical left. The other characters – a few guards, a gardener, a cocaine-snorting gringo named Paul – are no more substantial. But this eerie flatness is rather more what makes than what breaks Villalobos’ book. For <em>Down the Rabbit Hole</em> is a fable of the world without literature, of the world made false and shallow by lack of the narrative werewithal to plumb its more difficult depths. It is superficial because it is about the struggle against superficiality, about the spectacle of inadequate expression grappling with a dark and complicated world that lies ever beyond descriptive reach.</p><p>Mario Vargas Llosa writes in <em>Why Literature?</em> that an individual who does not read, or reads little, or reads only trash, has an impediment. Such an individual – such a world – is impoverished not only in words but in thought, “for the simple reason that ideas, the concepts through which we grasp the secrets of our condition, do not exist apart from words.” Tochtli tells us he’s precocious, or at least that he is thought to be. He is proud of many things, above all, his vocabulary, which includes such words as “sordid,” “disastrous,” “pathetic,” “devastating,” and “immaculate.” But it becomes clear that Tochtli does not know many words at all; least of all the ones he would need to discuss the traumas of his youth. He has only the words he knows, and each of them begins to bear a greater share of his voice’s expressive weight. Thus we learn that both wearing hats and the guillotine are “immaculate”; that there is “sordidness” both in the growth of hair and in a lonely life; that the memory, boredom and the nation of Mexico are each “disastrous” in their way.</p><p>What is left when a certain complexity of expression ebbs away is something flatter, more enigmatic, more akin to myth. A nod to this can be found in the symbolic, Nauhatl names of the characters, the allusions to Aztec mythos and sacrifices of human flesh. Villalobos’ novella, like Llosa’s essay, suggests that a world without literature is necessarily a world of superstition and myth. Language becomes incantatory, rather than revelatory, and in doing so approaches its own senility.</p><p>Yet, in the struggle for voice caused by limitation, there is also a new birth, a tearing of language from its frame. There are many things Tochtli cannot say, it is true, but there are also many things he can say that we cannot. The revelatory power of language lives on in neologism and creative misuse: thus we learn that politicians are “people who make complicated deals,” and that orifices are “holes you make in people so their blood comes out.” What <em>Down the Rabbit Hole </em>illustrates so aptly is that language can indeed die, but that the constraints of its obsolescence are also the seeds of its rebirth.</p><p>By Julian Lucas ’15</p>","2012-10-7","[516, 560, 409, 261]"

</span></p>{{58}}<p>Alex Wells:<i> You talk of not seeing yourself in your early work, which reminded me of something you said earlier about your relationship to Australian authors, about not seeing your own work in theirs. Now, this is a large and existentially fraught question—especially if we accept the premise of </i>Someone Else<i>—but let’s give it a crack: How and why do you see yourself in the work of some and not others?</i></p><p>John Hughes: It’s such a difficult question to answer, I think, because it’s really about what gets under your skin, isn’t it? What irritates you, what stimulates you—what gets in under there begins to take its own life within you. And it’s something I was thinking about a lot when I was writing that book <i>Someone Else</i>, and I just couldn’t get to the bottom of it, thinking: what is it about Kafka, or what is it about Chekhov, or what is it about Borges, or what is about Dostoevsky? Certainly for the Russian writers I might say it’s something to do with the romance I have as a result of my family background, but even there, there are a lot of Russian writers, you know, so why some rather than others?</p><p><span id=""more-792""></span></p><p>And I really don’t know, I mean, do <i>you</i> have a sense of why it is that you like some writers rather than others? For instance, with Wallace Stevens, I loved him as an undergraduate and wrote my undergraduate honors thesis on Stevens, and I think Stevens appealed to something very cerebral in me at that time—I think at that time I had a sense of myself as hopefully being someone who could write poetry in the way that Stevens wrote poetry, in the grandiose ways that young people can think about those things, because I loved Stevens’s verse and I loved his critical writings as well. I kind of fell in love with him, I think, and that’s strange because when you look at Stevens the man, he didn’t seem like a terribly interesting man outside the writing, but I think there’s something quite nice about that too, whereas if you look at Dostoevsky, the life is as rich and fascinating and bizarre as anything that’s there in the fiction. And so Stevens really appealed to me at a particular point in my life, but I find now it’s not that I don’t like Stevens as a poet, I just don’t feel the same things about him any more as I did at that time. Maybe that’s because I spent so much time writing about him that it just went a little bit stale. I did my PhD on Coleridge and I find Coleridge a little bit difficult to enjoy, now, so in a sense doing long critical study on a writer can be a kiss of death, unfortunately, though that doesn’t always happen.</p><p>At this sort of distance, now, I can see why Stevens appealed to me at that time, with his connection to Romanticism and some of the Romantic aesthetic ideas, and all of that interested me very much in an intellectual way. I think now my interests are somewhat different from that, so he doesn’t speak to me with the same force—doesn’t get under my skin in the same way he probably did thirty or so years ago—and maybe with an equivalent time period, I might be able to answer your question, but that’ll probably be a bit late for this interview, so it’s very difficult to say exactly why.</p><p>AJBW:<i> Have you always known you wanted a life in literature? Were there any major setbacks to that pursuit? I read a great story about your search for a “life in letters ” … </i></p><p>JJH: Well, what happened was when I was doing my PhD at Cambridge, not long after the beginning I became less and less interested in the scholarly work and more and more interested in writing creatively. So I spent more and more time working on things that weren’t directly related to my thesis—which is problematic when you’re supposed to be producing a PhD: it wasn’t neglected entirely but it was becoming more and more sidelined. My supervisor was very very keen on me staying on in Cambridge, so there was all this talk about finishing the PhD and then I would apply for fellowships so I could continue my time there.</p><p>What she said to me was that if all else failed, she knew some people in the postal service there, so I could always get a job as a postman in Cambridge. And so I thought it was a wonderful irony, there, that I would still be able to achieve a “life in letters” without getting a PhD.</p><p>AJBW:<i> We’ve already talked about the relationship between your reading and your writing, and a bit about the freedom you get from responding with irreverence to tradition—but let’s talk specifically about the English language and your growing up in Australia with a strong interest in Europe. What was the process like of rediscovering your roots, linguistically? Did you read these figures only in translation? I think of the quote in the preface to </i>Someone Else<i>, when the young man obsessed with Celan corners Max Brod in a Coogee Beach café: “It’s not just that I feel a stranger in my own language,” he laments. “I’m not even at home in my imagination.” What role does language play in your own imagination, especially as concerns your interest in exile and tradition?</i></p><p>JJH: I’ll approach this in a chronological, biographical way to build a response. My grandfather chose to come to Australia when he was in a displaced persons camp in Bagnoli, just outside of Naples, in 1949. He chose Australia because it was just about as far from Europe on the map as you could see: the choice was really one of “I want to get away from this mad hellhouse and I never want to come back.” And the second thing was that it was an island, so there wasn’t a sense of having these powerful voracious neighbors there.</p><p>So when he came out here, I think he had a very, very strong sense of a Year Zero when he arrived. He wanted his children to forget about Ukraine and his background altogether, to be cleansed of all this past and all this memory, and to begin as if they had been born here and grown up in this place. He forbade the language being spoken: English was the only language allowed. That was always going to be an impossibility, because the children had already had too much of Ukrainian Russian so that English would always be a second language for them, and it was always going to be a more difficult language for them to think in and speak in. So when I was growing up, when my grandfather wasn’t around, my mother and grandmother used to speak Ukrainian Russian all the time—it was never translated for me, but it was a language that I heard all the time, and when I was very young it was the only language I heard for a large part of the day, until my grandfather came home and everybody had to switch into English.</p><p>And so I grew up with one language in my head that was really just like music, because it had no semantic meaning for me—although it’s probably unfair to say it had <i>no</i> semantic meaning, because I think I gradually came to understand the meanings of many words, so I’ve found when I’ve visited over there that I can actually understand a reasonable amount, certainly more than I would have thought I’d be able to. These words stuck, or this language stuck, but it stuck as a kind of music, so I’ve grown up with the language I communicate in, which has meaning for me and in which I think, but then this other language which is like a stream that runs beneath it, which is like a kind of dark, musical language—a language almost without meaning, or a language which means like music, so it speaks to me directly, emotionally, viscerally, all these sorts of things.</p><p>I think that’s one of the reasons why, in just about everything I write, language seems to be a subject—whether or not it’s an explicit one, as it is say for instance in <i>The Remnants</i>, where translation is a key component, and where in fact the novel is set up on the premise that it’s translated from the Russian—but I’ve never really thought about this too deeply, because I’m worried that if I do I might kill the goose that lays the golden egg, in a way, I might remove whatever tension, whatever irritations are that that stimulate my imagination. In one way, I think, what I’ve really been trying to do is to make the semantic language more closely approximate to the musical language, or I suppose what I’m concerned about is the music of language, even though language is what we use to communicate. There’s something I always love that Robert Frost once wrote: he wrote about “the sound of sense,” and I think for me if something doesn’t sound right, then it’s not working.</p><p>So there’s that, and the other thing I’ve become more aware over time is that language knows much more than we do. In a sense, we’re spoken by language as much as we actually use the language, and by starting to listen to the musical qualities of language—this is something that poets get by forcing themselves into pre-existing structures like rhythms, rhyme schemes, <i>et cetera</i>: being forced to have second thoughts—you can begin to discover things that you didn’t know you knew. You learn things through the process of writing itself, and that’s really one of the key things for me, that when I sit down to write it’s hopefully to write things that I didn’t know I knew.</p><p>I think one of the real impetuses that is this dark language which is there that I don’t know, and I suppose that’s because in a way it probably takes me back to that experience of being there with my mother and grandmother, it takes me back to the origins of language itself—or certainly the origins of my language and language learning. I remember being at Cambridge in the middle ’80s, and Germaine Greer was giving a lecture, and she said that she never read things in translation. She’s never read any Thomas Mann, for instance, because she refuses to read a book in translated. And I thought, OK, maybe there’s some nobility in that desire. But I find myself thinking almost the exact opposite of that. I think that when I read in translation I’m getting two books for the price of one, that what I’m getting is what the original language has done inside of someone else, and in that process of translating one language into another, you’re actually opening new possibilities for doing things in the host language, so it’s always been for me one way of enriching the host language in this process.</p><p>So even though I might be able to understand a little bit of German, a little bit of French, a little bit of Italian, I certainly don’t know nearly enough to appreciate the value of translations—but it doesn’t really bother me because I’m not judging the quality of the translation itself, it’s more just about what it actually does in English.

I enjoy the fact that the original text remains largely inaccessible to me in terms of its semantics again, but at the same time it still has a kind of music for me, but because it’s a language that doesn’t mean, and I find that a really exciting experience rather than one that causes anxiety for me.</p>","2013-3-14","[348, 596, 592, 105, 561, 703, 409, 161, 276, 42, 400, 507, 141]"
"From the Archives: Lou Reed & The Velvet Underground","[2]","11","Krithika Varagur ’15","{{151 alignnone}}<p><em>Published in a “Special Poetry Supplement” to </em>The Harvard Advocate<em>, Vol. CIV, No. 3-4 (Fall 1971).</em></p><p>Having swapped out his usual moniker “Lou” for “Louis,” Lou Reed might just have passed unrecognized in the Fall 1971 issue of <em>The Harvard</em> <i>Advocate</i>. Luckily, in his contributor’s note, he tersely reassures us that yes, “Louis Reed…formerly of the Velvet Underground, writes poetry now.”</p><p>The finality of that description belies the twenty-four solo albums, forty years of performance, and reversion to “Lou” that Reed will undergo in the decades following this publication. But this issue of the Advocate seems to have caught him in a unique transitional moment between career phases, recuperating in his parents’ Long Island home, producing work that combines past and future song lyrics with free verse.</p><p><span id=""more-270""></span></p><p>Lou Reed was born in Brooklyn in 1942 and raised in Freeport, Long Island, where he was once prescribed electroshock therapy for homosexual behavior. He attended Syracuse from 1960-1964, during which he studied with the poet Delmore Schwartz, who would become a friend and lifelong inspiration. After several unsuccessful New York garage band stints, Reed finally put together the <a href=""http://us.myspace.com/velvetunderground1969"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a> in November of 1965, serving as lead singer and songwriter. As the band’s stardom rose, it was co-opted, along with the other worthy musicians of 1965 New York, into the galaxy of Andy Warhol. Under the direction of the artist’s Factory studio, the Velvet Underground toured the country with Warhol’s roadshow the <i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i> and recorded their legendary 1967 debut with German singer Nico.</p><p>But after making four albums in four years, and after losing both Warhol and Nico, Reed “retired” from the band in 1970. In his parents’ home, he recovered from the disillusionment of the commercial music market and began to reinvent himself as a poet.</p><p>Reed published eight pieces in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>, two of which are Velvet Underground lyrics. The song “Candy Says,” the opening track on the band’s self-titled 1969 album and a melancholy tribute to Factory girl Candy Darling, reappears in the Advocate in poem form. The case of Reed’s poem “The Coach and Glory of Love” is more interesting. With its prominent refrain, the poem seems to be a musical lyric as well—though, puzzlingly, not to any Velvet Underground song as of 1971. The words, in fact, turn up on an album only in 1975, when they’re slightly reworked as lyrics for the title track of Reed’s solo effort <i>Coney Island Baby</i>. Here we have a rare insight into Reed’s creative process, the opportunity to see how the poet-songwriter conceives of poetry versus song. We can ask ourselves: If “Coney Island Baby” was at least four years in the making, how long did his other songs ferment in his mind before reaching our ears?</p>{{69}}{{23 alignnone size-large}}<p>Even Reed’s poems that did not transform into songs are, as a group, good poems—not just good poems by a rock star, but poems that have aged well, that still feel genuine and fresh. They are clearly work of a poet just getting into his skin, an explanation for Reed’s overlaps with songwriting, his slight over-reliance on erotica, and his hesitance toward abstraction. Some of his later poems are more finessed (see “<a href=""http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/loureed/poems/lrpoems.html"" target=""_blank"">Thoughts Turn to Murder Late at Night</a>”) but his voice remains consistent.</p><p>Years later, some of Reed’s poems would find their way into print in the music magazine <i>Fusion </i>and in a 1973 booklet published by Nigel Trevena. But the Fall 1971 issue of the Advocate was likely the largest printing of Reed poems in any literary publication. Blithely discussing this in an <a href=""http://www.brucepollockthewriter.com/2012/03/02/an-audience-with-lou-reed/"">interview</a>, Reed says, “That’s why I get a kick out of publishing poetry in rock magazines. I mean, I’ve been in <i>The Harvard</i> <i>Advocate</i>. I’ve been in some of the heaviest. But I get a kick out of being in the rock magazines because that’s the people I want to read the stuff, not the people who read <i>The Harvard</i> <i>Advocate</i>.”</p><p>Of course, in 1972, Reed rebounded from his brief retirement to release his first solo album, <i>Transformer</i> (produced, no less, by David Bowie). But has Reed’s return to songwriting completed the full-circle movement of his career? Recent developments hint that the true closure of Reed’s career might still lie in poetry. Since 2001, he has produced a musical theater piece inspired by Edgar Allen Poe, written a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/11/magazine/songs-for-the-city-laurie-sadly-listening.html"" target=""_blank"">9/11 memorial poem</a> in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, and published a blank verse <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/244148"" target=""_blank"">tribute to Delmore Schwarz</a> in <i>Poetry Magazine</i>. Perhaps Reed is destined after all for that liminal space of the poet-musician; perhaps decades down the road, his fans will covet, more than any actual album by the Velvet Underground, Lou Reed’s aptly and portentously titled bootleg concert tape, <i>American Poet</i>.</p>","2012-11-13","[617, 560, 409, 467, 188, 690, 112, 157, 6, 475]"

There’s a lot of denial of the history of feminism, and how movements have grown organically out of that history, have mutated. Even within feminism, there can be huge omissions and revisions of history. In any case, the use of “new feminism” by McNally Jackson and Semiotext(e) on the “Heroines” blurb just shows a lot of ignorance and narrowness of focus</p><p>And in some ways, maybe that narrowness is okay. I concede in my essay that there is kind of something, which we can call new feminism if we want although it’s really a completely absurd name, that appeals to a very particular market of mostly white, mostly straight, highly-educated literary women.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>But then it seems that this “new feminism” is reaching an audience of precisely the women who are least disabled by the forms of oppression that feminists feminists seek to attack?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, although sometimes I think there’s another side to that privilege–like with heterosexuality. I sense that a lot of what dominates “new feminism” is the struggle of being a heterosexual feminist. Of knowing  a lot of male “feminists” (not saying men cannot be feminist, of course, but I think we all know a male “feminist” when we see one). I think a by-product of third-wave feminism, especially how it has grown on the internet, is this idea that we should all be competing to be the most oppressed, and to care most about the most oppressed in this bizarre competitive way. But it’s often not this simple hierarchy of oppression.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I wonder if the “new feminism” that we need would focus less on vertical achievement— on breaking the glass ceiling— and more on horizontal achievement— on providing basic rights (reproductive rights, childcare, etc.) for more, if not all, women?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, perhaps. Honestly, it might be stupid to be lumping together all these people in this “new feminist” demographic that I’m basically making up. If we’re including people who like Chris Kraus… I really like Chris Kraus!</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>So you’re including Zambreno and Chris Kraus in this category?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, sort of. The demographic of new feminists I have seen it includes women on one end who actually might be very well versed in certain aspects of feminist theory but who nonetheless have a certain narrowness of perspective that would enable them to read “Heroines” as an unproblematically feminist text. On the other end of the spectrum as I see it, there are women writing on Tumblr, people who take Marie Calloway’s work seriously as feminist, which is more ridiculous to me.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Totally. It’s tricky, though, because on the one hand I think it’s good to make women conscious of and opinionated about their own identity politics– to make us think about what it means to be a woman in today’s society. And I think that it’s good that there is some venue for women to do something like “feminism” in a really approachable, swallowable way. But, of course, the value of this is undermined by the poor value of the feminist content that you often find in such venues.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes. It’s totally true that feminism should contain something different for everyone, and it should be culturally specific. What annoys me about someone like Marie Calloway, and the fact that Kate Zambreno wrote this article about her, is that these are women who I’m sure are capable of a much more sophisticated kind of feminism. This “fucked up girl” aesthetic that Zambreno writes about is just so teenagerish to me. There was that interesting article about the way young women and girls get involved with communities and stuff on Tumblr that encourage self-harm… (<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-media-is-redefining-depression/280818/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/10/social-media-is-redefining-depression/280818/</a>)</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>The internet is incredibly powerful!</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>And it seems irresponsible (as well as just silly) for smart, grown-up women writers to be fetishizing that or celebrating it or even just approving it. It’s true that the internet is powerful, and I worry that as content becomes increasingly personalized the internet will turn on feminism, or fail it.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Because people will just have their own views reconfirmed. I mean this is already happening, and with all aspects of online content. The “silver bubble” thing.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>An interesting reversal or over-extension of “the personal is political.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes that’s true</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>What appear to be platforms for freedom and choice are actually just driving us further inwards and narrowing our vision.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yeah. So in that way I think feminism should maintain a very critical relationship to the internet.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>So I’m interested if you think there are any people today who write good and sophisticated culturally specific feminism, to recommend instead of Zambreno?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Do you mean on the internet or just in general?</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I guess in general— I mean, you mentioned your interest in Donna Haraway and bell hooks?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes. bell hooks is a good person to mention because although she’s an academic her work does not read as dry or overly scholarly. I already mentioned Hilton Als, who might not even explicitly identify as a feminist, and who says some strange and borderline misogynist things sometimes, but whose crazy and radical way of thinking about the world is really helpful to the kind of feminism I want to practice. There is a cool reclamation and re-celebration of the more interesting radical feminists––Shulamith Firestone, Ellen Willis––that’s going on right now that I think is great. Beatriz Preciado, I am reading her book now, “Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitcs in the Pharmacopornographic Era”. It is dazzling.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Great!

"Theater Review: Witness the Witness in “Bad News!”","[16]","11","Anna Hagen ’15","{{13 aligncenter size-full}}<p>“I was there!” the actors cry and cry again in “Bad News!”, a new theater piece directed by JoAnne Akalaitis and composed with Kate Attwell and Greg Taubman. “And you were not,” the actors imply as they stare at the audience sitting in rows of metal folding chairs. The Greek tragedies, from “Antigone” to “The Bacchae,” shed as much blood as the goriest video game, but Greek religion reserved public killing for religious sacrifices, and convention reserved onstage hitting for the comedies. Violence in the tragedies follows a law of controlled blindness: the audience can see the suicidal leap, but the fall must crash out of sight. Messenger speeches, long and breathless reports from the invisible offstage world, serve to fill in the blind spots. “Bad News!”, a staged reading co-presented in July by Poets House and River to River Festival, strings together the messenger speeches from a dozen Greek tragedies (and a few Roman, Renaissance, and contemporary takes on Greek tales). “Bad News!” explores the messenger speech as a dramatic tactic. In the process, it illuminates the figure of the messenger and explores the fraught and complex nature of bearing witness.</p><p>Seven remarkable performers — actors Bill Camp, Karen Kandel, Joan MacIntosh, Elizabeth Marvel, Efthalia Papacosta and Rocco Sisto, and singer Nora York — all play the part of Messenger. They sit on the rough stone steps that edge the Poets House courtyard, an improbable garden squeezed between apartment buildings in downtown New York and here made into a makeshift performance space. They wear everyday clothes; only the scripts in their laps distinguish the performers from the audience. The sky eases toward night, the audience falls hush, and then the performers, shot through with sudden urgency, scramble to their feet and speak.</p><p><span id=""more-1154""></span></p><p>Akalaitis, Attwell, and Taubman have<i> </i>excavated fourteen plays for their messenger speeches and lined up the monologues one after another. The process makes for ninety minutes of epiphany, the performers in an absurdly constant state of emergency. By the third or fourth urgent message, calamity, now routine, fails to shock.  And so focus shifts to the messenger — usually a nobody, a nameless witness who appears for one scene, describes someone else’s tragedy, and then submerges once more into the anonymity of the Chorus.</p><p>In a traditional Greek tragedy, the messenger’s moment of prominence is a public act of self-erasure, for the messenger’s bad news overshadows his or her own presence onstage. “Bad News!” traces the figure in the erasure marks. Akalaitis has arranged the messenger speeches like an orchestral score, and the monologues follow an aural logic rather than a narrative arc. The performers begin in unison, the unfamiliar sound of choral speech suggesting the cadences of young children learning lessons. Then one actor, desperate to deliver his news, breaks into a monologue. Another actor interrupts to give her message, and then another cuts in. The performers assume and discard accents and mannerisms, and at times shift into Greek, or song, or back into unison. The surfeit of interpretations makes the messenger an Everyman even as the layered voices make up a hymn to the Messenger.</p><p>Akalaitis defies recent trends toward immersive theater, 3-D movies, and onstage worlds that overflow into the audience and transform the spectators into actors. No missiles shriek toward the seats, and no blood-caked actors drag audience members onstage. “Bad News!” makes the audience witness to the event, or rather, to its telling. The audience to a Greek tragedy peers at the play’s action through the lens of the messenger speeches; the audience to “Bad News!” ignores the distant tragedy to examine the scratched and warped lens itself. The medium is the message, and in this case, the medium is human.</p><p>Of course, “Bad News!” is plain in part because it is a staged reading. But its simplicity makes the courtyard’s edge the threshold between the audience and an unseen world where anything can happen. “I was there,” the performers cry, and run onstage with messages like souvenirs from that invisible other world, <i>there, </i>where a war rages between brothers, where Jocasta learns that Oedipus is both her husband and her son, where<i> </i>a band of wild women scratch the earth and draw up milk and wine.</p><p>A glitzy staging might milk the messenger speeches for spectacle. “Bad News!” takes a gamble and foregoes visceral gut-punch, shushing the Greek tragedies’ kings, gods, and warriors in order to ask why the messengers speak. The messengers admit that delivering the bad news means reliving the painful past and risking the listeners’ anger, and yet their long monologues overflow with awful detail.</p><p>Is this hysteria? Talk therapy two thousand years before Freud?</p><p>A messenger ran from the Marathon battlefield home to Athens, cried out the news of victory, and collapsed. So the marathon was born, and so the messenger died, a story I never understood until this summer. It wouldn’t have hurt anyone if the messenger had taken a breather; it seemed to me that the messenger ran himself to death for no reason.</p><p>Now, months after the bombing at the Boston marathon endangered my friends and paralyzed my city, I still find myself talking about that day. “I was there,” I hear myself repeat. I can guess why the messengers from the story and from the plays risk everything to deliver their messages. It isn’t a sign of hysteria or a cry for attention; it is a witness’s response to tragedy. The telling transforms the messengers from helpless spectators to storytellers. It lets them salvage control from their helplessness. By reliving what should never have happened, the messengers drag the tragedy from the offstage world of possibility to the onstage world of consequence. They speak to realize what they have seen. In the process, they share the burden of witness with all the audience. “I was there,” the actors say, and now you were, too.</p>","2013-9-4","[516, 596, 708, 562, 493, 409, 208, 330, 715]"
"Marginalia: Listening to “The Snow Man”","[23, 5]","9","Kevin Hong ’15","{{134 aligncenter size-full}}<p>The advent of winter always brings Wallace Stevens’s “The Snow Man” to mind. Reading it this time around, I have been fascinated by the relationship between the poem’s lines and their surrounding space. Just as Stevens directs our attention toward the silence that accompanies the snowy season, an emptiness that asserts itself in its negativity, so he asks us to listen more closely to the “stuff” before and after each line and stanza.</p><p><i>Stanza</i>, in Italian, means “room.” In “The Snow Man,” Stevens gives us five rooms; each room has its own white space around it, its own silence. Yet the poet does not close the door at the end of each stanza — rather, a single sentence runs <i>through</i> every room, a draft through an old house. There is a unique tension in this poem, one that pits pause against flow. The reader, straining to bridge one clause with the next, is resisted by a “nothing that is.”</p><p><span id=""more-1313""></span>To explore this tension more concretely, I have produced three voicings of “The Snow Man.” The first is conventional; the second incorporates more silence between each line and stanza; the third is rather extreme. I do not intend for the readings with more silence to be better than the normal one, or to say that this poem is only about poetry. I just want to show something that is perhaps obvious: that in “The Snow Man,” spatiality is special. For Stevens, tension leads to attention. To be in the world, or to read a poem, is to burrow into a place which is full of snow.</p><p>Reading 1 (Time: 1:00)</p><p>Reading 2 (Time: 1:13)</p><p>Reading 3 (Time: 1:54)</p><p><em>Illustrated by Sam Richman ’15</em></p>","2014-1-7","[177, 450, 467, 431, 595, 618, 141]"

"Brando Acts Alone: A Response to Jonathan Sacks’ “The Moral Animal”","[16]","11","Alexander Traub ’13","<p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">The Brooklyn dockworker proles of <i>On the Waterfront</i> are D-and-D: “deaf and dumb.” They don’t hear nothing and they don’t say nothing, because they know that mob boss Johnny Friendly has a passion for shooting canaries. The system changes when luckless former boxer Terry Malloy—we know him as Marlon Brando—decides to testify against Friendly in court. That leads to the death of Brando’s brother, to Brando’s own unemployment, and to a near-death encounter at the fists of Friendly’s goons.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">We love Brando for this self-sacrifice. But what makes it the right thing to do? Jonathan Sacks, a rabbi and British parliamentarian, thinks he knows the answer. Like many sociobiology evangelists, Sacks believes that a potent brew of neurobiology, game theory, and natural selection can furnish us with a vindication of the human appetites for religion and altruism. His <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/opinion/the-moral-animal.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=0"">op-ed for the New York Times, “The Moral Animal,”</a> was most read on their website earlier this week.</span></p><p><span id=""more-449""></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">According to Sacks, Darwinian evolution’s main premise is that “biological and cultural makeup constitutes ‘adaptive fitness.’” In other words, our physical and behavioral traits spring from the same genealogical well. We explain both by discovering their biological utility. However, Sacks goes on to note, seemingly maladaptive tendencies have persisted in humans. Chief among these is the embrace of self-sacrificial behavior, especially of the religious variety. Though this altruism wastes our resources and diverts our individual drives to eat and procreate, Sacks claims they bolster the genetic status of our social group. The unselfishness emphasized by morality and religion gets humans to cooperate. Cooperation in a group benefits each of its distinct members. Altruism, and with it morality and religion, have been naturally selected.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Like all prophets who claim omniscience, Sacks is peddling imperfect scripture. The first problem with his logic is that it misunderstands human nature. The primary trait that distinguishes humans from other animals is our capacity for non-genetic learning. We are born with a set of evolved instincts, but we grow up in a cultural sphere that follows its own perverse logic. Its historical changes have taken place outside the scope of evolution. For that reason, a set of good guesses about evolutionary advantage won’t tell us the full story about how we our take our coffee. Similarly, it cannot provide an exhaustive explanation for present-day altruistic beliefs.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">This problem with facts is dwarfed by a problem with theory. After claiming that evolution explains the persistence of religion in a secular age, Sacks also claims that evolution <i>justifies</i> religious belief. Given an explanation of religion as an evolved mechanism for group-bonding, we humans need to keep it in our arsenal of weapons to combat “the individualism of the consumer age.” But the social cohesion derived from religion leads to inclusion and exclusion alike: it encourages donations to hurricane relief, but it also foments violence in the Middle East. And if we could in fact justify all our behavior from natural selection, we’d also have to include a justification of human cruelty and violence. Evolution can tell us what is, but it cannot tell us what ought to be.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">Brando’s friends on the dock are reduced to animals. Friendly’s underlings choose only a few guys for work everyday, so to get a job the dockworkers must sullenly follow the rules of their harsh environment. Brando’s nobility comes from his refusal to accept this brutal struggle for existence, from his understanding that the dignity of sacrifice beats the sustenance of complacency. His act is hardly non-adaptive—it leads to fair working conditions for everyone on the dock—but its motivations are indifferent to adaptivity. Brando’s solidarity rests with himself, and his own consciousness.</span></p>","2012-12-29","[516, 485, 707, 132, 189, 268, 483, 626]"
"TRIAL: Heroines, Part 1","[5]","11","Indiana Seresin \’15 and Liza Batkin \’15","{{160 aligncenter}}<p><span id=""more-1386""></span></p><p><strong>Liza Batkin: </strong>You refer in your essay to Zambreno’s disdain for “wifing,” and her assumption that, as you put it, “to wife is to lose.” I found your criticism of this assumption really compelling, and hoped that we could expand upon it. In particular I wonder what, in Zambreno’s view, defines the identity of the “wife” and the action of “wifing,” and how she understands the relationship between the wife’s socio-economic position, as the domestic laborer of the household, and her more socio-cultural role, as living in the shadow and service of her “genius” husband.</p><p><strong>Indiana Seresin: </strong>Well I think what you’ve pointed out is that Zambreno is juggling two different conceptions of “wife,” without clearly differentiating between them. The first is produced through discussion of the lives of artists, writers, significant cultural figures… “great men.” This is the idea that being the wife of a genius involves suspending your own creative work in order to facilitate theirs. Figures like Solphia Tolstaya, Tolstoy’s wife, come to mind. I read that she was the copyist for <em>War and Peace</em>–she copied out the entire manuscript seven times.</p><p>Anyway, this kind of wife is separated from the domestic drudgery associated with the other kind of wifedom. It is unlikely that Zelda Fitzgerald did much cleaning, and she would have had help raising their daughter. I read a description of this kind of cultural wife–I don’t know if that’s the right phrase, maybe “bourgeois wife” is better–in Hilton Als’ <em>White Girls</em>, in the first essay, “Tristes Tropiques.” Als is describing a friend who he refers to as SL, standing for Sir/Lady, who is black and male, and who falls in with a crowd of New York feminists in the 1970s. The quote is “SL became a wife, supporting a number of friends’ and lovers’ work while his own work took a backseat.” What I really like about the way Als uses this concept of “wife” is that he destabilizes it from being determined by sexuality and gender. It seems often that Zambreno is making this essentialist argument that because she is literally a wife/woman she is also the cultural “wife,” even though her husband, John, often seems to perform the wife role at least as much, if not more than she does.</p><p>This is something quite common to second wave feminism–the idea that because you are woman, you are automatically subjugated in some essential way. Whereas people writing feminist theory now, and writers like Als, refute that kind of thinking. In Als’ essay, S/L is a black man who becomes the wife to a group of assumedly white lesbian feminists.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>It’s almost as though Zambreno is conflating “wifing” the husband with “midwifing” the husband’s creative work.</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, definitely. The issue of domestic/caring labour is actually very distinct from the cultural wife question, though Zambreno keeps them intertwined. Domestic labor is probably the most devalued category of work there is–maybe apart from sex work. I don’t think that people are ready to believe that the most important work done in this country is done primarily by poor women of color who are often immigrants.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>(Who are hired by the white, rich, successful “have it all” women who are happily reading Lean In and shattering the glass ceiling).</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, yes exactly. And not just the Sheryl Sandbergs of the world–that same line of thinking is in Heroines, is in that interview with Mary Gaitskill that I quote. It’s everywhere.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Part of the reason I bring up Sheryl Sandberg is that I went to this panel last night, called “New Directions in Feminism”; one of the panelists, Mikki Kendall, a black feminist with a large Twitter presence, was particularly critical, and rightly so, of Sheryl Sandberg’s breed of feminism. Sheryl Sandberg’s feminist agenda is to create more female billionaires. But, as you say, in order to work the hours that Sandberg works at Facebook probably requires extra help around the house, probably done by women, and probably by women of color. Kendall’s point was that the people who are harmed most by the oppressive, patriarchal structures that feminists are fighting against, are those who do not have a voice in the media; are not those who are left out of the boardroom, but those who are struggling to meet the most basic needs for themselves and their families, who can’t afford child support, who are legally compelled to raise a child they didn’t plan to have, etc. What we need, in Kendall’s (and my) view is to build from the bottom up, instead of relying upon a quasi-neoliberal hope in “trickle-down feminism.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, exactly. And not as some kind of favor or deliberate political correctness– but to find the solutions. Zambreno argues that, as a married female artist, she is in some kind of trap. Either she or John has to be the wife–either way that’s not fair. But when you take the time to listen to/read what non-dominant–queer, Third World, women of color–feminists have to say about this topic, you’ll see that this isn’t really a trap at all, or it doesn’t have to be.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I think we’ve sort of been circling around the second question we were going to discuss, which concerned Zambreno’s targeting of the modernist husbands for their wives’ oppression.</p><p>I’m kind of interested in jumping to the question of internet girl writing, and new feminism, if you’re game?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>It’s probably a flaw in my essay that I’m so dismissive of that genre, and call for things like “boundaries of quality,” given what we were just talking about–feminism that exists in the margins of dominant culture, that blossoms on the internet. Maybe I should start by saying that I’m actually quite critical of a lot of internet feminism too. The most alarming trend, to me, is how the relationship between online feminist theorizing and social capital allows for “calling out” to become a kind of currency. As flawed as that Michelle Goldberg piece is, this is something she picks up on. It’s treated better in an essay on the website on <a href=""http://feministing.com/2013/12/20/on-cynicism-calling-out-and-creating-movements-that-dont-leave-our-people-behind/"">Feministing</a>.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Yeah, in last night’s panel, though, Amber Frost, another online feminist, was trying to defend internet feminism by pointing out that the problems Michelle Goldberg was picking up on are simply inherent to radical politics, activism, organizing, and not to feminism necessarily— and it may be that the splintering and “calling out” that would happen anyway in any radical political context is just more condensed and apparent in an online domain like Twitter?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>In my opinion “calling out” isn’t so much the issue… it’s the kind of popularity/social currency dimensions of that practice. It becomes posturing, showing off, narcissistic and/or cliquey… I mean these things are bad in themselves, obviously, but the bigger problem to me is that it’s so reductive.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Reductive and besides the point— the fruits of internet battles are, as you say, “followers” and caché; reaping these rewards distracts from the real fruits of the real battles that we should be fighting….</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, exactly. Anyway, so that’s my biggest gripe with internet feminism. I have a different issue with Zambreno’s internet girl writing.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>Right, I was just going to ask about that. Because it seems like her internet girl writing actually has little to nothing to do with the kind of internet feminism that Goldberg is targeting… Or am I wrong?</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yes, very little. Kind of bizarrely so.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>I was reading this great article by Emily Cooke, a senior editor at TNI, called The Semiautobiographers (<a href=""http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-semiautobiographers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-semiautobiographers/</a>), and it begins with a mention of Zambreno’s interest in bulimic blogging…</p><p>“In the first post on her blog, Zambreno said that she was inspired by Dodie Bellamy’s Barf Manifesto (2008). Bellamy had decried the “oppressiveness” of the neatly constructed essay, lodging an appeal for chaotic, disorderly writing….And so, with Bellamy… as her disheveled [model], Zambreno “wrote and wrote and wrote and read and read and read and vomited it all up.”</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>I am not against that idea per se, though I am against the use of bulimia-as-metaphor, as I say in my essay. But I wish Zambreno (I guess Dodie Bellamy too) would interrogate more why that idea is tempting. Because my first thought is like, duh, of course that mode of writing is appealing. It’s easy. You can call the guidelines of structuring nonfiction essays masculine or patriarchal, but what about other kinds of structure? Emily Cooke talks about Allison Bechdel’s new, different, definitely non-patriarchal use of structure. It’s deliberate and complicated… not like vomiting at all.</p><p><strong>LB: </strong>There’s also something tricky about the analogy that Bellamy makes between the “oppressiveness” of the neatly constructed essay and the “masculinity” of the same— to equate structure and form with masculinity is just to reify misogynist dialogues regarding the “nature” of women, their writing, their minds…</p><p><strong>IS: </strong>Yeah, totally.</p><p> </p><p><em>Illustration by Michelle Long ’16</em></p>","2014-4-27","[450, 591, 224, 714, 518]"
"From the Archives: Camus and Mann?","[2, 5]","11","Victoria Baena ’14","<p>The November 1951 issue of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> addressed a single theme: William Faulkner. Reviews, essays, and excerpts from dissertations crowded the now-yellowed pages of the magazine, tackling everything from the author’s novels to his childhood. Two names in particular jump out from the list of contributors: Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. The <i>Advocate</i> editors were eager to milk this literary windfall, placing their names in bold print on the cover of the issue, and noting their “gracious acknowledgment” to contributors including Camus and Mann “for making this issue possible.” In the Contributors’ Notes, the two are described as follows:</p><p>“ALBERT CAMUS, possibly France’s leading contemporary novelist, has seen his novel <i>The Plague </i>translated into nearly every modern language.

"Moonshine: Catacombs","[14, 13]","5","Victoria Baena ’14","{{115}}<p>A few hundred feet below the cabs and wheezing busses that circle the rotunda at Denfert-Rochereau, a plaza in a southern neighborhood of Paris, the remains of six million Parisians lie quiet and dense. Wheelbarrows began to transfer the bodies here in the late eighteenth century, the city’s central cemeteries groaning under the weight of their holdings. The bodies were, by then, giving off an odor that had started to seep into the central markets, clinging redolently to the fruit. Here in the so-called catacombs, skeletons from the medieval era rub shoulders with the bones of Robespierre and Marat. Tourists can pay eight euros to wander among the stacked-up skulls.</p><p>These are not the only tunnels sprawling underneath the breadth of Haussmann’s boulevards. People tend to forget that much of the southern part of Paris is constructed on a delicate crust, fault lines slicing just atop a porous mantle. You remember only when there is a collapse, a whole southeastern neighborhood, for instance, that crumbled into its foundations back in the sixties. The tunnels were quarries, at first: it was their stones that built the city when the south was no more than barren land, when builders could cart their materials from here over to the Panthéon and the Louvre. As Paris’s borders were teased outwards, construction overlaid the old quarries, sealing them in like streets under the dried lava of Pompeii. There are almost two-hundred miles of these pathways coursing beneath the urban lanes.</p><p><span id=""more-1084""></span></p><p>Of the intrepid pioneers who seek to probe the quarries’ depths, Emilien R. is a typical case. At twenty-three, he is jagged-nosed and tall, with big hands and feet that give him a pieced-together, gangly look. He has just graduated from a prestigious French university, and he’s smart, sharply funny, though if caught at a quiet moment a sort of desperate wild streak might briefly muddy his eyes. It is summertime now and he is not sure what he’ll do next. But tonight he is the leader of an intimate gang of <i>cataphiles</i>, lovers of the catacombs, a term employed more often by the media than by the practitioners themselves. He hands out headlamps, stuffs beers into the backpacks of each friend, and tells the group to follow him. It is nearly eleven o’clock.</p><p>From Denfert-Rochereau it is a short metro ride south-west, then a hike a few blocks north, where Emilien turns and stops. One by one the group members hoist themselves over a fence and ease down a hill to an abandoned train track and tunnel. They walk for what seems like miles into the gaping hollow, until there’s no longer light from behind and none yet from up ahead. Emilien studies a map. He shines his headlamp onto the right-hand side of the tunnel, the faint beam illuminating a small oval hole. Ducking down to crawl through headfirst, he says, “This is it,” and one by one each ducks down after him, emerging into a damp limestone alley barely two meters tall.</p><p>Until 1955, when entering the catacombs was made illegal, they were easier to reach: there were entrances in parks, under staircases, in the basements of the Latin Quarter’s prestigious private schools. During World War II, you sometimes hear, French members of the Résistance used the tunnels as headquarters, as did the German occupiers. Underground battles ensued, perhaps, muffled by the earth above. Or maybe just a truce and quick exchange of cigarettes. Beginning in the sixties, the police began to seal these entrances. Now they are harder to get to and it’s never clear, upon arrival, if they’ll still be open. The police patrol inside, sometimes, handing out tickets, a sixty-five euro fine. This deters some but not others.</p><p>Emilien, for example, comes down here often. He has just begun to bring his girlfriend; he has friends among the Thursday-night regulars. Many are young, college-aged or in their twenties, and remind you of Emilien: a Dean Moriarty type, a kind of intelligence with an itch to escape, burrowing under Paris instead of hurtling across the American plains. You can track down these groups through voices, lights, or someone’s tinny iPhone music. Every so often the winding alleys empty out into a columned cavern, which reveals them, huddled around candles, drinking, hanging out.</p><p>There are slabs of stone in these caverns worn down with decades of use. There are plaques ensconced every so often within the alleyways with names of streets — Rue Dareau, Rue Feuillantine — vague reminders of a time before the passages were ossified below-ground. When it rains, puddles clog the alleys: you can avoid them at first, but are soon slogging through up to a few feet of water (“Don’t wear any clothes you care about,” Emilien tells his guests). If there were a leak or rainstorm the <i>cataphiles</i>’ chances would not look good.</p><p>There is a middle-aged man here, too, a caretaker at the Luxembourg Gardens, who has been coming down for sixteen years. (“How often do you <i>descendre</i>?” they ask each other, “who was here last week when I couldn’t <i>descendre</i>?”) In the seventies, they remind each other, there were real parties, punk raves and neon lights, drugs and music and late-night glee. It was the definitive alternative scene.</p><p>It’s quieted down by now. To <i>descendre, </i>now, is to enter a world stiller and calmer than above. It is an oddly melancholy realm, chilled and damp even on a muggy July night, where you could stay for days and, like the Chilean miners, never know how long you’ve been gone.

"The Early Advocate: e.e. cummings","[2]","11","Sarah Hopkinson \’13","{{111 alignnone size-full}}<p>Published in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>, Vol. XCV, March 7, 1913</p>{{189 alignnone size-full}}<p>Published in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>, Vol. XCV, March 21, 1913</p><p>The later poetry of Edward Estlin Cummings is instinctively recognizable to any lover of poetry. His page is a visual canvas, upon which words are not simply sounds that peal back to produce meaning, but aesthetic objects laid out upon the page.</p><p>E.E. Cummings was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at 104 Irving Street, just a stone’s throw from Annenberg Hall – where Harvard’s freshman now dine. He was the son of a Harvard Professor – Edward Cummings – who had been one of the first Professors of Harvard’s burgeoning Sociology Department. Born and raised within the echoes of student’s footsteps as they rushed to class, Cummings would enter its gates as a freshman in September 1911, although he would continue to live at home until his Senior Year.</p><p><span id=""more-93""></span></p><p>During his time at Harvard, Cummings was known for his tastes in avant-garde music and literature, and for being a member of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> and a founding editor of another literary publication, the <i>Harvard Monthly</i>. Having written poetry every day from an early age, a number of Cummings’ poems written during his time at Harvard were published in <i>The Harvard Advocate. </i></p><p>The poems “Summer Silence” and “Sunset” were both published in different editions of <i>The Harvard Advocate </i>in March 1913 – when Cummings would have been a Sophomore. The first of the two, “Summer Silence,” is written in Spenserian Stanza – a fixed verse form created by Edmund Spenser for his epic poem <i>The Faerie Queen. </i>The Spenserian Stanza is composed of nine lines, eight of which are in iambic pentameter, and the last of which is in iambic hexameter. (A structure to which the poem does conform, with the exception of the sixth line, “The empty vault of Night with shimmering bars,” which adds a final unstressed syllable to the end of the line, a departure from the five feet line known as a feminine ending.) The second of the pair, “Sunset,” is written as a sonnet and, in this manner, both poems register a sharp comparison to Cummings’ later, structurally experimental poetry.</p><p>Although both poems consort with traditional forms and seek to convey a single, externally conceived experience, some images and word constructions in each poem betray traces of Cummings’ later dictatorship of language – how he will create and synthesize words to formulate new meanings, or how he will revise grammatical laws to suit his poetical needs. For example, in “Summer Silence,” Cummings uses the phrase “Limply, down-sagging” to describe the air. Although the synthesis of “down” and “sagging” is not particularly surprising, his dissolution of the gap between two signifiers already signals a frustration with language and its inadequacy, that will force him to devise new linguistical rules and forms in later years. Or let us compare this image of the air, whose limpness is distressing and almost perverse, with two lines from Cummings’ poem “spring!may-” published in 1952:</p><p>(the earth and the sky</p><p>are one today)</p><p>In “Summer Silence,” the air sags down near to the earth, but in a manner that is uncomfortable, stagnant. In the lines above from “spring!may-”, just as in “Summer Silence,” the earth and the sky merge, coalesce; yet in this later poem, Cummings’ language is direct and unadorned (a mark of his later verse); whilst the image of the sky and earth merging is something positive, and reinforcing.</p><p>But perhaps a comparison of Cummings’ earlier poetry published here in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> to his later, matured style is not necessary or constructive. For, regardless of what Cummings will produce later, the imagery utilized in “Sunset” is intrinsically visceral, and successfully makes concrete the grandeur of a fleeting impression. He uses a metaphor for sunset as the light stitching up the “shroud” of the dead day– this move is powerful, and although somber, poetic. Moreover, the poem talks about “day’s fillets” from which “Night shakes out her locks,” where the use of the word “fillets” suggests surgical amputation. The poem is dark and almost terrifying in its depiction of a sunset. Yet it is in this ability to excite mood and emotion, often in a manner that leaves one confused as to how this emotion has arisen, where Cummings’ talent lies.</p><p>By Sarah Hopkinson ’13</p>","2012-10-17","[617, 113, 560, 106, 409, 467, 13]"

"Hat Trick: Censor / Censure","[11, 16]","8","Kiara Barrow ’16","{{35 }}<p>“Ten dollars,” the man behind the counter intones, hardly bothering to look up from the register. In mere seconds I am handed a ticket — an old fashioned, receipt-paper square that leaves a slightly chalky residue on my fingers — marked for the film I hadn’t even had time to indicate. His wry smile betrays amusement at the reason he had guessed my order — the string of college-aged customers who had arrived for the same purpose, the 8:30 pm showing of this year’s Cannes Palme d’Or winner.</p><p>Rather than pirating an illicit copy for private viewing like fifth-graders at a sleepover secreting an R-rated movie in a duffel bag, as we might have in another time and place, my friends and I were received at <i>Blue is the Warmest Color</i> without question or controversy. Unlike our Idahoan counterparts, we watched it like any other film, seated amid the sounds of crackling popcorn and commentary from the couple behind us.</p><p>A classroom scene: students crowd around an oblong seminar table, poring over the author’s explanatory key to an intricate text. At one end of the room, latecomers quietly negotiate seating. At the other, two professors gesture toward a stack of volumes. The work in question is <i>Ulysses</i>, the reason for our supplementary after-hours gathering. Eighty years earlier, we would have been hard-pressed to locate even an underground copy of<i> </i>the novel save voyaging to Paris’s Left Bank, but few would give a second look (except perhaps a sympathetic one) to a student reading it on the T today.</p><p><span id=""more-1261""></span></p><p>The US court’s 1933 overruling of <i>Ulysses</i>’s obscenity charge formally freed the controversial work of pornographic allegations with the realization that the author’s groundbreaking approach to literary realism was what “led at times to what many think is a too poignant preoccupation with sex in the thoughts of his characters.” This decision seems like a milestone for public awareness of the function of art. That Joyce’s entire objective in <i>Ulysses</i> <i>necessitated</i> the inclusion of sexuality seems more obvious now, but it is a testament to his genius that the novel was so challenging to societal assumptions about what should be acknowledged and what suppressed.</p><p>If Joyce’s sexual descriptions are somewhat veiled by his highly metaphoric prose, there is no question as to whether or not viewers might pick up on the explicit aspects of <i>Blue is the Warmest Color</i>. The inclusion of the most intimate scenes in a relationship between two young French women have set further challenges than <i>Ulysses</i>, testing the progress of the past eighty years in parsing the boundaries between life and art, and the media attention paid these moments out of their context does the film the same injustice suffered by the novel so many years ago. The considerations of the <i>Ulysses</i> case must also be applied here, unless the contentious reactions to the film have occurred for a different reason.</p><p>In 2013, (largely) absent the Puritan values imposed by overt judicial restrictions on the arts, do we attempt to manufacture these boundaries ourselves by encouraging outrage or controversy at cultural objects like <i>Blue is the Warmest Color</i> to make them more exciting, more worth skipping homework for? As we age and grow further from that middle-schooler watching a movie banned by his parents, the adrenaline rush of getting away with something essentially harmless but tantalizingly rebellious seems increasingly elusive. In an era of availability and permissiveness, I sometimes wonder what it would have been like to read <i>Ulysses,</i> or worse, <i>Lolita</i>, illegally and surreptitiously, or gaze with greater wonder at a banned and salacious new film. I’m sure this incarnation of nostalgia is utterly misguided, as it so often is, in its failure to account for the terrible realities of artists living under oppression and censorship — back then and still. It also submits to that simplistic impulse to equate excitement with meaning. So perhaps my point is really the opposite, and I’m expressing gratitude for the freedoms I enjoy today. Is that growing up? But it’s still a little of the other, too — that search for rules to break, even if they’re further under the surface — lest we forget the many reasons we still have to push boundaries, rebel, and engage in some healthy subversion, in art or otherwise.</p>","2013-12-1","[307, 516, 383, 725, 735, 334, 235, 380, 530]"

It is like we are playing thumb wars but with our feet; mine are on yours, then yours on mine and the grit from the bottom of your feet rubs off onto the tops of mine and I make a face and tell you: <i>You are disgusting,</i> to which you reply: <i>But nothing like you,</i> and round and round we go and now both of us are laughing so hard we can’t even hear the sound of Mom watching the 9 pm news in the sitting room. The curtain is pulled to one side so we can see the sky and we will call our game, this cross between a lover’s dance and thumb wars, “A Dance in the Moonlight”. You start to sing, repeating the phrase over and over again, and I start to sing too, and our voices sound not too different from the way the stray cats do when they fight one another for leftovers when someone has left the trash uncovered, but I will remember this tune, still, when I am twenty-one.</p><p><span id=""more-1009""></span></p><p>The Nairobi version of moonshine we call <i>Chang’aa, </i>a cheap brew that is made from fermented sorghum or millet and sold for as little as 20 US cents a cup.

I have never tasted <i>Chang’aa, </i>but I feel like I can identify with Abedi Pele in a way: I have experienced some harmful intoxications of this life. If I could delete seven-thousand miles and two years of our long-distance relationship, I would tell my little sister, the girl with whom I danced in the moonlight, that she should not trust so easily in this world, that people’s cups come with hidden agendas and there are many inebriations in this life to avoid like the plague: you must, for example, run away from untrustworthy men who ask to take you on harmless walks by the river, and block them on Gchat when they try to send instant messages <i>reminding you how</i> <i>special you are</i>. You must flee from the Devil and demand that he get behind you before you cannot get him our of your mind, and now I — I who should be the fun and carefree sister — am at the verge of panic as I compile a list in my head of all of the horrible addictions of this <i>adult</i> life — in alphabetical order for easy reference — in a “How to Have a Heartbreak-Free Life” cheat sheet.</p><p>I am ashamed of how little shame I have over the sheer amount of time that I spent on her boyfriend’s Facebook, all the while crossing my fingers that there should be no accidental “likes,” as I trace out hundreds of connections from his life for a storyline to fill the freezes in the Skype calls between my sister and me. And now I am on my sister’s profile, wondering where she learned how to do her makeup like that in the past two years, and <i>who is the boy with his arm around her and is that a Tusker® bottle behind her shoulder when I’m not even of legal drinking age in this country and does she grind when she goes out to clubs? and —</i> I would laugh if it were not me, at how ancient I feel when she reminds me that I was her less than two years ago.

"Catch a Fire","[14, 5, 1]","11","Julian Lucas ’15","{{188 aligncenter}}<p>I am crouched on the edge of Port-au-Prince rooftop, a hooded figure with a blunderbuss and a rusty machete strapped to my back. A throng of white men in frock coats and silk stockings bustles by below, some on their way to a nearby slave auction. There, a line of shackled men stands on a platform, under posters reading “Nègres À Vendre”—“Blacks For Sale.” It’s broad daylight, and my rooftop ledge stands only a few feet off the ground. Yet the men below don’t seem frightened. It’s possible they can’t believe their eyes: Black assassins aren’t quite commonplace in colonial Saint-Domingue. Whatever the reason, their loss is our gain.<span id=""more-1452""></span></p><p>A slave driver in a red bandana—our target—leads a chain gang of slaves toward the auction platform. “Animals!” he shouts, in a cartoon villain’s rasp. I release the space bar; Adéwalé leaps into action. He rises like a bird of prey with bulging biceps for wings, drawing his blade midair before crashing down upon his victim like a metric ton of reparations checks. The crowd of planters shrieks. Extracting his machete from the dead man’s body, Adéwalé leaps to his feet—but another treacherous overseer is already coming at him with a cutlass. He knocks the man off balance, circles him on tiptoe, then splits his head open like a melon. A glitch freezes the gruesome animation just as one of the liberated slaves begins to express his gratitude. “You would do the same,” says Adéwalé, “if you could.” The overseer has nothing to add to the conversation—moaning, he hangs in the air like a kebab.</p><p>There’s no denying it: <em>Freedom Cry</em>, like every game in Ubisoft’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series, is as thrilling as it is ridiculous. As Adéwalé, a self-emancipated slave and member of the Assassin Brotherhood, the player sails the Caribbean in a tricked-out former slave ship called the Experto Crede. Assisted by a crew of Maroon rebels and grateful freedmen, you get to infiltrate plantations, dredge up sunken treasure, wrestle sharks, chase down slave ships, and fire broadsides into the splintering hulls of evildoers. Mostly, you get to kill masters with the tools of slavery—because nothing says poetic justice quite like a slave’s machete harvesting a sugar-planter’s neck.</p><p>When Dr. King Schultz shoots the sadistic Calvin Candie at the end of Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Django Unchained</em>, he turns to Django and says, “I’m sorry. I couldn’t resist.” He might as well be speaking for American culture at large: audiences have become fixated on stories of slaves’ revenge. <em>Freedom Cry</em> was released in the same year that <em>Django</em> won an Academy Award, and James McBride’s <em>The Good Lord Bird</em>—a novel about John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry—won the National Book Award for fiction. These may be three very different works in three different media, but their success says something about the kind of slavery fictions today’s audiences crave. They want catch-a-fire stories; narratives of master’s comeuppance.</p><p>For some, slave revenge in fiction represents progress. As TheGrio’s Danielle Belton writes in a <a href=""http://thegrio.com/2012/07/28/slave-revenge-django-unchained-in-film-fantasy-slaves-finally-give-the-master-his-comeuppance/2/#s:jamie-foxx-kerry-washington-django-unchained-comic-con-16x9"">review</a> of <em>Django</em>, “A black historical revenge fantasy means… confront[ing] the ugliness of our origins.” A valid opinion, but one that shouldn’t prevent us from looking into the sometimes troubling origins of these revenge narratives. Specifically, we must recognize that among the first readers craving stories of master’s comeuppance was master himself. The fear of slave rebellion haunts early American literature—not only the forgotten propaganda of slavery’s apologists, but the books of some of the greats. Foremost among these is Herman Mellville’s novella <em>Benito Cereno</em>, the story of a slave mutiny at sea told from the perspective of the “heroic” Captain Delano, who brings it to a bloody end. At the end of the book, Delano addresses the slave ship captain he has rescued, asking “what has cast such a shadow upon you?” “The negro,” he replies.</p><p>Indeed, the shadow of “the negro”—and the masochistic thrill whites found in contemplating it—was the first impetus behind slave revenge fiction. Slave owners and white abolitionists alike believed that slavery (and the presence of Black people in the United States) was an unstable and potentially explosive social contradiction. Slave revenge was the fantasy of its swift resolution—a vision of divine justice for some, an apocalyptic nightmare for others, and largely useless to slaves themselves.</p><p>These are very different times, but it’s hard not to see similar impulses at work in our own slave revenge renaissance. We live in a world that has largely failed to address the legacy of Atlantic slavery, and revenge fantasies offer the clean, cathartic satisfactions of retroactive resolution. History can be a painful thing to contemplate, and going back in time to punish villains is more immediately satisfying than trying to imagine the past on its own terms. Rather than slavery as it might have been, revenge fantasies address themselves to modern guilt or outrage over what the Martiniquan poet Aimé Césaire once called “the atrocious inanity of our reason for being [here].” They have more to do with our own feelings than the lives of the dead. But satisfying as they are, the revenge stories audiences love today have little to do with the real lives of slaves and slave rebels.</p><p>What differentiates slave revenge fantasies from other stories of slave resistance is their emphasis on crime and punishment. They like to linger pornographically on slavery’s horrors, which justify and intensify the pleasures of imagined retribution. At their best, they are premised on the principle that “it is beautiful that sin should exist to be punished.” But in the context of slavery, stories of sin and punishment cannot help but center on masters. No matter how much time Django or Adéwalé spend on screen, they are not really the heroes of their stories. Subordinated to our contemporary desire to fix history, they are reduced to mere instruments of justice. Slavery and slave-owners remain the stars of the show: as Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/01/toward-a-more-badass-history/266997/"">points out</a> in a column on <em>Django</em>: “Slave revenge has the luxury of making slavery primarily about white people.”</p><p>James McBride’s novel <em>The Good Lord Bird</em> is a brilliant subversion of this kind of revenge narrative. Throughout the novel, McBride juxtaposes John Brown’s Quixotic mission to destroy “the infernal institution” with the pragmatic strategies of resistance practiced by the novel’s slave rebels and Underground Railroad conductors. For McBride’s John Brown, slavery is a villain in a morality play. For the slaves, it is a lived reality, something to be dealt with strategically. The gap between the two makes for many of the most interesting moments in the novel. The novel’s narrator—a twelve-year-old boy John Brown frees and christens “Little Onion”—has a sharp sense of the divide between his own interests and those of the zealous abolitionists. At a rally where John Brown is speaking, Onion observes the crowd:</p><p>“They called for them rebels’ heads, announced they’d trounce ‘em, bounce ‘em, kill ‘em, deaden ‘em where they stood… It was like a big, long lynching. Everybody got to make a speech about the Negro but the Negro.”</p><p>As McBride’s novel artfully demonstrates, heroic revenge fantasy tends to upstage the difficulty and complexity of real slave resistance. Adéwalé’s swashbuckling hijinks in <em>Freedom Cry</em> look pretty silly next to the activities of the real slave rebels of the colonial Caribbean—people like Jamaica’s Nanny or Haïti’s François Mackandal. The game’s Maroons look silly, too. Bland freedom-fighters with anachronistic liberal values, they are nothing like the colorful guerrillas of Caribbean history, who allied with native peoples, practiced military magic, and fought to create traditional African societies in the hills of the New World. They had better things to do than punish their former masters.</p><p>To give credit where credit is due, <em>Freedom Cry</em> is the first game set in the colonial Caribbean that doesn’t erase slavery altogether—as have twenty years of titles like <em>Pirates</em>, <em>Empire Total War</em>, <em>Age of Empires III</em>, <em>Colonization</em>, and <em>Port Royale.</em> But its fixation on comeuppance—on slavery as a morality play—is a serious limitation. Revenge, in art as in life, is too easy. It’s a way of sidestepping the hard imaginative work necessary to bring historical characters and worlds to life. Slave resistors weren’t puppets in the hands of our modern outrage, but real people making difficult decisions in an uncertain world. Some of them rose up in arms, and others ran away. Some of them turned to traditional African religion, while others re-invented Christianity, appropriating it for their own purposes. Some of them fought to end slavery once and for all, while others—like Jamaica’s Maroons—made treaties with their former masters.</p><p>Expecting games to demonstrate this level of nuance might seem farfetched. But many games—especially RPGs and historical strategy games—already do. One of the things that makes games so special is their capacity to simulate difficult choices, the kind you have to make without knowing what happens next. A game that really brought the world of rebel slaves to life would confront players with some of these choices—and their consequences. For all its good qualities, <em>Freedom Cry</em> doesn’t offer such an experience. But it’s too early to count out the genre entirely. Beyond revenge, games might yet have something to contribute to the way slavery is imagined and remembered.</p>","2014-8-11","[311, 450, 660, 672, 467, 146, 412, 261, 335, 262, 221, 89]"

The “conceptual turn” and the post-modernist critique of the 80’s and 90’s cleared room and created new possibilities for painting, When I started my MFA at Columbia in 2005, I had studio visits with critics who were in disbelief that I was making grid paintings. Several people told me that the grid was a dead end. Many of them were painters who had emerged in the 90’s, and at that time, making grid paintings had a very different meaning. I am so grateful that I am painting in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. I think that through the post-modern critique painting has been renewed.</p><p>HC: How did you get into painting? Did you always want to become a painter?</p><p>EA: Painting came to me through other interests; Actually, I didn’t like my first oil painting class when I was 11 or 12 at all. I wasn’t interested in trying to make a copy of something that already existed, or make something “look like” something else. In college I wanted to be a philosophy professor and then an architect. It was at Penn’s architecture school that one of my professors suggested that I might actually be an artist. I was very moved that this teacher recognized me as an artist, for sure, but I thought to myself:  “Being an artist sounds hard and painful! And so subjective. I would rather stick with architecture.” But by then, it was too late, and the seed had been planted. That’s how I got to painting – life led me to painting.</p><p>HC: What were your primary interests? Do you think that they still affect your work?</p><p>EA: I studied philosophy at Swarthmore as an undergraduate, in a really rigorous, cerebral environment. What I learned through philosophy was very appealing to me — the kind of connections that you have to make between disparate thinkers and texts, my favorites being Kant, Hegel and Nietzsche. During college I thought that I would become a philosophy professor. But after college I worked in public TV (actually here at WGBH) and then got into urban design working for a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. That’s how I ended up in architecture school, where I realized that I wanted to become an artist.</p><p>When I first started making work, I wanted to do both architecture and fine art. I was making installations in relation to specific sites, a lot of which had to do with light — camera obscuras, windows and such. But these works, in the end, seemed all about painting. Painting was perfect in terms of representing the process of making. It’s what’s most effective in expressing my interests that have been always in me.</p><p>I still do read philosophy these days and I do feel that it is an important field for me. It does not form a one-to-one relationship with my work, and I don’t want my work to exemplify philosophy, but it is definitely a part of the conceptualization process. My first solo show, for instance, was called “A Priori”, a Kantian term. Phenomenology has also been a lasting interest, especially the role of perception. I titled my project at Radcliffe “Painting as a Site of Resistance,” and I proposed to make “Slow paintings that engage in a process of temporality and embodiment, which inhibit easy translation into forms of reproduction and image dissemination, since they are made to be seen in person.” This proposal turned into my show here called “Metabolic Paintings.” One of the Aromatherapy Paintings from the show was featured in <em>The Harvard Advocate</em>.</p><p>HC: The painting that was published in <em>The Harvard Advocate</em> is interesting in the way that it touches upon viewers’ olfactory senses. What was the drive behind these paintings?</p><p>EA: When I moved to Los Angeles after living in New York City for eighteen years, it felt like I had a sensory re-awakening. Spring starts in LA in January and by mid-February, the entire city smells like jasmine. And the orange blossoms, eucalyptus, lavender…. For an east coaster it felt like I was on a different planet. I started noticing people’s fragrances — people in LA wore much fresher fragrances than people in NY. I got some essential plant oils to make my own fragrance. When I got the Pollock-Krasner Grant, I left LA to go to Pittsburgh where I could live more cheaply and use the grant to make paintings. I got there in May and spring was in bloom– I had this strange experience of having six months of spring. It was in Pittsburgh that I got this idea of adding the plant oil with oil paint and combining smell and color. It just happened. But as soon as I got the idea, I realized it was huge.</p><p>HC: So nature was a critical source of inspiration.</p><p>EA: I think the concept of nature affects me in a more existential sense than a literal sense. Of course, when people look at the checklist for my show and see the materials used in the paintings, they’re going to think that I am very much invested in nature — the use of rabbit skin glue, urine, plant oil and such. More so than the material, though, I put importance in the experience of seeing my works. That is the reason why I want people to look at them for a while and really engage with them. My paintings are always in a process of “becoming” and they are, in some sense, recreated with each viewing. I see them as “actants,” which, according to Bruno LaTour, is “something that acts or to which activity is granted by others. It implies no special motivation of human actors, nor of humans in general.” I am very interested in this human/non-human subjectivity in my paintings.</p><p>HC: Do you consider your grid paintings from a similar standpoint?</p><p>EA: I actually don’t think that grid paintings necessarily are “opposed” to the concept of nature, as they might seem. Rosalind Krauss once wrote, “In the spatial sense, the grid states the autonomy of the realm of art. Flattened, geometricized, ordered, it is antinatural, antimimetic, antireal,” but the grid has historically been presented in relation to nature. Mondrian’s abstract language started with trees and the ocean and Agnes Martin once named her geometric paintings with words such as beach, island, and desert flower, though both Mondrian and Martin renounced their connection to nature at a certain point. With the grid paintings I have a firmer sense of how the finished product is going to look like, but then again there is so much chance in grid-making as well. This apparent opposition is one that I don’t want to solve, something that I want to continue to explore. These seemingly disparate works also show how process is such an important factor in my works.</p><p>HC: Do you think that a similar force is at work with your oxidation paintings?</p><p>EA: With oxidation paintings the process is such an important factor. They are so vulnerable — slight alterations in light and moisture will change them in unexpected ways. With other paintings, things are done when your paint dries up. With these, the possibility of changes and the unexpected nature of the changes all constitute the process.</p><p>HC: While the “incompleteness” that stems from possibility of alteration constitutes the formal aspect of the oxidation paintings, thematically, they are an interesting subject to consider within a broader art historical narrative. Andy Warhol made paintings out of urine. Eva Hesse’s sculptures are associated in terms of “écriture feminine” – the inscription of the female body.</p><p>EA: Eva Hesse is actually a huge influence on me, although she explored materiality in this uniquely idiosyncratic, personal way. One could say that there is an obvious connection between us, given her use of grids and examination of materials.</p><p>I love that my work can provoke such questions on feminism and gender. Part of the reason why people raise such questions would be that my works are about the binary relationship between the grid and the body, which do not negate each other but coexist.</p><p>HC: I think co-existence is not only an important word to describe your oeuvre, but also with regards to your role as a research fellow at Radcliffe Institute. What do you think of Harvard as a place to create art? Can art making and institution coexist?</p><p>EA: It’s amazing to get such extensive support from Harvard; I feel so lucky to be here because of the quality of resources that I have access to. Other research fellows have been influential to my works as well. The writer, Lewis Hyde, for instance, showed me how to use gold leaf and I am now making 24k gold leaf paintings which will be shown in New York this fall.</p><p>The most basic thing, though, is being able to do a show that is not commercial. I had this idea of creating a wooden floor, and the Institute was doubtful at first, but people loved it and they’re keeping it for a while.</p><p>People are thinking about Kant and graphite with me here. I love it.</p>","2014-3-28","[603, 348, 450, 301, 527, 219, 323, 99]"

"Showtime: A Show for Two","[21]","7","Liza Batkin ’15","<p>It’s showtime.</p><p>Well, the show has begun, but I remain as immobile as the audience members looking expectantly at me. The show is Stravinsky’s <i>L’Histoire du Soldat,</i> and I am the Princess. I spend the first half of the hour-long performance sitting profile to the audience, my back resting against the stage-left wall, my face wearing a pout fit for a paralyzed princess. I remain woefully comatose until a dashing young soldier arrives to rouse me with his fiddle.</p><p>With my body at rest, my eyes roam freely about the theater. Sometimes I watch the show that unfolds before me, the very show I will soon enter, whose plot I will complicate, whose characters I will confront. Sometimes I watch Stravinsky’s music swim about the theater, over the balcony, between seats, upward towards the impossibly high, arched ceiling. Sometimes I watch the audience and relish in the inversion of spectatorship: <i>Who is the performer now?</i> I silently dare them.</p><p><span id=""more-439""></span></p><p>The theater’s architecture provides endless fodder for distraction. I study the curled wooden planks that snake along the walls, allegedly built for acoustics but more decorative than functional. My eyes follow their path, skimming familiar faces in the foreground. They travel to the ceiling and fixate on the microphone that hangs above the stage, attached by two diagonally opposed wires. They travel to the empty seats on the balcony inscribed with innumerable names of alumni, illegible from the stage. They travel to the exit doors, aisles, elliptical railings: the theater is a labyrinth for my restless pupils.</p><p>With my vision occupied, my mind roams freely. Or, rather, my mind strays predictably to the choreography that I am about to perform. The benefits of visualizing success have been researched in countless studies. Sitting onstage in nervous anticipation, I subscribe avidly, if only as an amateur, to their findings. Though my eyes are directed at the “Devil,” my character’s antagonist, I do not see her gesturing wickedly; I see myself dancing in her place. Though my tune of the “Pastorale” enters my ears, I do not hear its mournful melody; I hear the “Tango” that will soon arouse me from my slumber and incite my torso to fall in line with the drum’s deep rhythm. Though my body is placed in a seated posture, I do not feel erect; I sense my body dip and rebound as it will when the drum sounds.</p><p>I return my eyes to the stage:<br/>
The Soldier beats the Devil at cards, intoxicates him into oblivion, and slides him off the stage. The narrator encourages him, “Now, take back your own again!” and the septet begins to play. My heart knows this line; this is its cue to begin to palpitate.</p><p>By the time I rise to dance, I have already performed a one-woman show—a royally pouting, still-bodied, roaming-eyed, mentally-rehearsing, heart-quaking circus act. A one-woman show whose turn-out was embarrassingly low. Just me and you, in crummy seats, for a half-hour performance that couldn’t position itself on the right side of the curtain.</p>","2012-12-19","[733, 560, 236, 518, 700, 405, 564]"
"A Conversation with John Hughes: Part I","[3]","11","Alexander Wells \’13, President Emeritus","<p><em>In February, Advocate member Alex Wells sat down with Australian writer John Hughes and recorded the following interview.</em><em> Part I is published here: stay tuned for Part II. You can find John Hughes’s work published in the Advocate’s latest issue, </em>Origin.</p>{{14 aligncenter size-full}}<p> </p><p>Alex Wells: <i>The two stories you’ve given us for the </i>Origin<i> issue come from your newest book, The Garden of Sorrows,</i> <i>a collection of reverse animal fables that will be published by University of Western Australia Publishing later this year</i>. <i>How did the idea for this project come about?</i></p><p> </p><p>John Hughes: The idea had been with me for quite some time. Largely, I think, it came about during the period when I was working on a couple of my earlier books, from experiences working in foreign countries where I wasn’t terribly familiar with the languages. I found that what I began to notice in places where lots of people gather are the things we don’t usually notice when we understand the language, that is, the whole range of nonverbal communication that goes on between people. And it struck me that when I was doing this, what I was looking at was a series of different kinds of animal behavior, really. (I don’t mean to put myself outside that: my own was a kind of animal behavior as well, being more predatory, or at least observing the others.) And so it made me start thinking for some reason about how close to animals we really still are—because basically we are animals, aren’t we? So that got me thinking about fables and the way that animals have been used to tell stories, simple stories with a kind of moral, and then I began thinking about the metamorphosis and the classical tradition of transformation.</p><p>What I’m giving you here is a cluster of things, and eventually they all sort of came together in terms of thinking: well, given our Antipodean context here, it might actually be quite interesting to turn the metamorphosis around in a way and so to start with animals—but animals which have already distinctly human qualities. To start with animals, but Australian animals, which aren’t romanticized at all—they’re not cute and cuddly and they’re mean and nasty animals in many instances—and to present these animals in dramatic situations and to look at the transformation, but this time with animals turning into human beings.</p><p><span id=""more-746""></span><!--more--><!--more--></p><p> </p><p>AJBW<i>: What work is Australia specifically in </i>The Garden of Sorrows<i>—and in particular native fauna, which is indigenous here in a way that Australians descended from immigrants are not</i>?<i> In what way is it an Australian work, if at all?</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: Well, again I suppose there are a couple things there. The first one is that this is <i>my </i>place, the place where I was born and where I have grown up, so the landscape and those particular animals are things I’ve either experienced directly or have been part of the mythology or the stories of this place.</p><p>But I think, secondly, it just seemed to me that Australia was such an appropriate place. In <i>The Garden of Sorrows</i> I’m thinking about Eden, in some ways, a sort of paradise—and the garden that seems to be at the start of certain mythologies and storytelling traditions—and again, because Australia is such a dry, desert-like place, it struck me that this is a different way of thinking about a garden. A garden, but much more barren, or primeval, or perhaps even a perverse sort of paradise. Or an inverted sort of paradise—so, in this paradise, sorrow reigns supreme rather than the innocence that’s there in the Christian tradition.</p><p>So I think it comes of the nature of this place, and because that seemed to present me with certain possibilities where I could examine European myths and theologies but in a topsy-turvy setting—that appealed to me very much. Using Australian animals, many of which are known now outside of Australia but usually known because they’re cute or strange or whatever else, I could play around with both local knowledge and international knowledge and also play around with the kinds of assumptions that exist about these creatures. And use those assumptions to my own ends.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: The theme for this issue is </i>Origin<i>, and among the submissions we’re publishing there is predictably much talk of travel and of homeland—and your interest in the garden fits in well, here—but we’ve also found a recurring interrogation of ideas about authorship and originality among the pieces. How would you say your story engages with these two issues, or with the theme more broadly?</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: Well, yes, <i>Origin</i> as you say is the garden, so there’s a sense of the beginnings of human life, and trying to look at—in stripped-back or simplified form—some of the key problems and dilemmas that have long plagued us in terms of human social interactions, morality, those kinds of things.</p><p>One of the other ways of thinking about <i>Origin</i> in terms of these stories is that because, as I said, I’m using a number of stories from particularly Greek myth, which certainly are there behind much of Western literature—so for me, I’m going back to a lot of these stories and putting them in a landscape and a place where it might at first seem there isn’t a very strong connection at all. And perhaps we might then say, if we’re thinking about what makes a story original or the origins of a story more generally, I think there is a certain number of stories that are available that we can tell. And everything else is a variation: what we’re continuing to do is to write variations on these.</p><p>So for me, one of the things that was very stimulating to my imagination and to the way the stories developed was the sense of planting something foreign on this soil and seeing what would come of it. And I suppose if there’s anything original in them it’s in that bringing together of two things that probably haven’t been brought together in this way before. It’s that sense, I suppose, of making new these ideas and stories that pre-exist us, so that the reader is aware and there’s this echo: they sort of carry the trace of their origins but hopefully they are also making something which is unfamiliar as well.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: Your title set me thinking at first about Borges and his </i>Garden of Forked Paths<i>, and this talk of stories already being written reminds me of the imaginary inaccessible tomes in that collection. Let’s talk about influence, something I know is important to your earlier work and which has come up here again. As a quote-unquote historical college magazine, the Advocate has a long tradition of writers—and especially poets—who feel very strongly the weight of tradition upon them. Harold Bloom talks about the “anxiety of influence,” with a special attention to the way young poets work to forge their own clear imaginative space. You wrote poetry as an undergraduate, and I wonder if the anxiety or forced creativity with respect to inheritance has been a concern of yours even since you were young. And also whether the mixture of fiction and non-fiction you are writing now allows different modes of response to the anxiety of influence than, say, poetry would have.</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: I don’t know whether this is partially to do with growing up in Australia—and perhaps some sense of feeling outside the mainstream, or at least the mainstream of both the American literary tradition and the European one—but I think there’s a freedom that comes from the sense of anonymity. A part of you thinks no one really cares what you write anyway; there’s such a small audience here that in some ways it doesn’t really matter—and I’m not saying all Australian writers feel like that but I’m thinking about myself in this instance.</p><p>So that’s one level, but I think also because of my Ukrainian background, I’ve always felt a very strong connection from the early days to Russian or Central European literature. And there, too, I feel like an outsider, because I haven’t grown up in those places, I’m not writing in those languages, and I’m still writing from over here—that has given me a strong sense of freedom, because I feel like I can sort of claim these people as part of my heritage while at the same time being outside that heritage. So in a way, I haven’t really felt a weight of anxiety in terms of the people I might claim as being my influences: it’s more that I feel I can develop a very individual relationship to them. So I found that to be quite liberating, and I can have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>In terms of what you were saying about this working in a sort of borderland between fiction and non-fiction, it’s something I enjoy playing on, certainly in <i>Someone Else</i> and in my other works as well. If we think about borderlands geographically, as well, they’re the most interesting places in a lot of ways—obviously they can also be quite dangerous places, and they can be places where there’s a lot of desperation, a lot of tragedy and pathos as well—but at the same time these are places that have marked the boundaries between cultures, between different kinds of geography and history and whatever it might be. So I think the borderland between genres is particularly resonant as well.</p><p>And I feel that maybe this is the other thing to do with me being both over here, so growing up in this place and feeling already isolated and slightly homeless, but also feeling an attachment to a culture which is twelve thousand miles away, although I think of it as mine. I can have a sense of irreverence, or if not irreverence then a feeling that I can pick the bits I like and play around with them while ignoring the others, and I don’t feel as if I’m committing some kind of sacrilege. So I guess that feeling of not quite being at home in either place hasn’t meant that I feel like I haven’t got a heritage or a tradition—because in a lot of ways, literature is borderless, we can grow up in this place and we can read Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Melville and we can still make things of these writers—it’s more that my attachment to it much more oblique or harder to specify than I imagine it is for young American writers who are growing up in America, or young English writers who are growing up in England, or young French writers who are growing up in France.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: Still, though, you are born into an Australian tradition of sorts, aren’t you? Which is still a tradition, although it likes to efface itself and is often self-deprecating. The sculptor Robert Klippel is the only Australian who makes it into your cast of characters in </i>Someone Else<i>. Do you see yourself as part of an Australian literary tradition, in any sense, and do you feel the shadow of older Australian writers hanging over your work?</i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: I don’t, no. And that’s not to say that I don’t read Australian authors and like Australian authors, because I do, but I don’t really see myself and my work within whatever those traditions might be. Maybe this is something that might appear later in the development of a literary history of this place as well—that the sorts of things I’m doing may well appear to be part of something going on—but I don’t feel consciously to be part of any tradition or to be in any real dialog with that tradition.</p><p>One thing I was conscious of in writing the stories in <i>The Garden of Sorrows</i> was that I didn’t want them to seen in any way as being pastiches of Aboriginal dreamtime stories or those sorts of stories. There’s a danger I think for an Australian writer when you start telling stories about animals, and using the landscape, they might be seen in some way as totemic or as borrowing some kind of indigenous storytelling more. And I wasn’t trying to do that at all—not because I don’t that that’s an interesting and powerful literary mode, because I do, but because it’s completely alien to me and I certainly wouldn’t want to be assuming that right or that voice. It’s not the reason for doing it, but like I was saying to you before, although the stories are concerned with Australian animals, the stories themselves have their origins in Europe and elsewhere rather than here.</p><p> </p><p><i>AJBW: The Advocate, as you know, is a college magazine, and we are proud to have published what one Pegasus once called “the juvenilia of the great.” Some recent expeditions into our archives have seen us dig up the early poetry of Wallace Stevens, T.S. Eliot, Adrienne Rich and more. We also are proud to have published—and to continue to publish—the juvenilia of the mediocre. What do you think when you look back at your own early work? </i></p><p> </p><p>JJH: I try as hard as I can not to: I almost studiously avoid it. But at the book launch for <i>The Remnants</i> last year, the person who launched the book, Mark Mordue, was the editor of the student magazine at Newcastle University when I was studying there, and Mark published what I think were my first publications. They were very long poems under the influence of the mad Cantos of Ezra Pound—I’d been reading quite a lot of Pound in an American Lit. course, and I think it appealed to the worst sides of my sensibility and of my writing as well. So Mark, after that launch, reminded me of this, and he rather mischievously had some copies of these things that he forced me and others who went out to dinner afterwards to look at. And it’s funny because I’d almost forgotten that I’d done those things, so on one level it was really quite strange because it was like reading the work of someone else, someone I felt very little connection to whatsoever—and it didn’t bring back for me that person, I couldn’t get back into the mind of that person, I couldn’t really remember, almost, having written those things.</p><p>Also, I think, I am particularly obsessive about my work, and if you look at my books, things that appear in one sort of pop up in the next one as well. And this whole business I was talking about before, of taking something and putting it in a different context, and I think with taking something from one book and putting it somewhere else, strange things happen there as well. So for my own psychological health I just have to leave things behind and forget about them, because otherwise I think if I were to return to them I’d be obsessed by them in the end—so especially once something’s been published, I try not to return to it again.</p>","2013-3-7","[348, 596, 592, 105, 234, 652, 152, 409, 276, 129, 31]"

We proudly bathe in our own fluids, now emerging. We bask in <i>our</i> mess, <i>our</i> grime. We commit everything to the page, gibber whatever bubbles up at whomever is around to hear, even if it is only ourselves. The censor who usually edits our interjections for the world’s eyes and ears has called in sick. Now the truly subversive, the destructive, the half-formed, and the superfluous are all part of the discourse. And it is good.</p><p>Fever is as bacchanalian as it is solipsistic. It is the mind’s last hurrah before either death or recovery, the difference between which has narrowed. We pursue it in hallucination and intoxication, but fever must arrive uninvited: a devil that can cross any threshold he’d like. Fever is a nightmarish house party that leaves the body ravaged and scarred from the inside out. From the outside, fever is never pretty. Fortunately, for the feverish, nothing is ever outside.</p><p>Fever often walks on small feet, leaving behind bloody prints. External worlds fall to its conquest as swiftly as internal worlds swell. The feverish is also the viral, the bubonic. The endgame. It is therefore also the leveler, the carnival of horrors that rolls into town without fanfare.</p><p>For this theme, we expect to read about feverish dreams haunted by inflamed beasts, transfigured nights without sleep, novels written by the hour, streams-of-consciousness set to boil, and bodies bursting at the seams. We expect to see quarantines and extinctions, self-propagation and self-destruction, ramblings and diagnoses, bodies revolting and minds being set free. Perhaps we may make out a light at the end of the tunnel; but even this may be an illusion that fever only projects.</p>","2012-11-15","[542, 560, 165, 467, 318]"

And everything else is a variation: what we’re continuing to do is to write variations on these.</p><p><span id=""more-678""></span></p><p>So for me, one of the things that was very stimulating to my imagination and to the way the stories developed was the sense of planting something foreign on this soil and seeing what would come of it. And I suppose if there’s anything original in them it’s in that bringing together of two things that probably haven’t been brought together in this way before. It’s that sense, I suppose, of making new these ideas and stories that pre-exist us, so that the reader is aware and there’s this echo: they sort of carry the trace of their origins but hopefully they are also making something which is unfamiliar as well.</p><p><i>AJBW: </i><i> Let’s talk about influence, something I know is important to your earlier work and which has come up here again. As a quote-unquote historical college magazine, the Advocate has a long tradition of writers—and especially poets—who have felt very strongly the weight of tradition upon them. Harold Bloom talks about this as the “anxiety of influence,” with a special attention to the way young poets work to forge their own clear imaginative space. I know</i><i> you wrote poetry as an undergraduate, and I wonder if anxiety or forced creativity with respect to inheritance has been a concern of yours ever since you were young. And also whether the mixture of fiction and non-fiction you are writing now allows different modes of response to the anxiety of influence than, say, poetry would have.</i></p><p>JJH: I don’t know whether this is partially to do with growing up in Australia—and perhaps some sense of feeling outside the mainstream, or at least the mainstream of both the American literary tradition and the European one—but I think there’s a freedom that comes from the sense of anonymity. A part of you thinks no one really cares what you write anyway; there’s such a small audience here that in some ways it doesn’t really matter—and I’m not saying all Australian writers feel like that but I’m thinking about myself in this instance.</p><p>So that’s one level, but I think also because of my Ukrainian background, I’ve always felt a very strong connection from the early days to Russian or Central European literature. And there, too, I feel like an outsider, because I haven’t grown up in those places, I’m not writing in those languages, and I’m still writing from over here—that has given me a strong sense of freedom, because I feel like I can sort of claim these people as part of my heritage while at the same time being outside that heritage. So in a way, I haven’t really felt a weight of anxiety in terms of the people I might claim as being my influences: it’s more that I feel I can develop a very individual relationship to them. So I found that to be quite liberating, and I can have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>In terms of what you were saying about this working in a sort of borderland between fiction and non-fiction, it’s something I enjoy playing on, certainly in <i>Someone Else</i> and in my other works as well. If we think about borderlands geographically, as well, they’re the most interesting places in a lot of ways—obviously they can also be quite dangerous places, and they can be places where there’s a lot of desperation, a lot of tragedy and pathos as well—but at the same time these are places that have marked the boundaries between cultures, between different kinds of geography and history and whatever it might be. So I think the borderland between genres is particularly resonant as well.</p><p>And I feel that maybe this is the other thing to do with me being both over here, so growing up in this place and feeling already isolated and slightly homeless, but also feeling an attachment to a culture which is twelve thousand miles away, although I think of it as mine. I can have a sense of irreverence, or if not irreverence then a feeling that I can pick the bits I like and play around with them while ignoring the others, and I don’t feel as if I’m committing some kind of sacrilege. So I guess that feeling of not quite being at home in either place hasn’t meant that I feel like I haven’t got a heritage or a tradition—because in a lot of ways, literature is borderless, we can grow up in this place and we can read Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Melville and we can still make things of these writers—it’s more that my attachment to it much more oblique or harder to specify than I imagine it is for young American writers who are growing up in America, or young English writers who are growing up in England, or young French writers who are growing up in France.</p>","2013-3-1","[450, 592, 105, 466, 650, 492, 652, 152, 409, 276, 129, 229]"

"Not In the Game","[14]","11","Indiana Seresin ’15","{{113 }}<p>We had a joke about the Foreign Missions Club. We called the people that came in or out of it “missions” and pretended to spy on them. Anytime we saw someone walk past it we’d shrink behind a bush and watch them. <i>Where’s that mission going?</i>, we’d say. <i>He looks extra suspicious today.</i> The missions would glance back angrily at us. We’d giggle.</p><p><i>It’s so silly</i>, I used to think, <i>because people can’t be missions! </i>In my head I dragged out the words in the way children do when they think they are saying something funny, in the way that almost always makes it unfunny. <i>People</i> can’t be<i> missions! </i></p><p><span id=""more-1095""></span></p><p>*</p><p>Playing pretend games, we used to interrupt ourselves and say, <i>Not in the game, I need to go to the bathroom. </i>It was ok, for some reason, to momentarily duck out of whatever fantasy we were inhabiting as long as we preposed it with “not in the game.” That was one of our rules, which were themselves without origin. When we laughed at the missionaries, I’m sure what we really wanted to do was walk up to them and say, <i>Not in the game, what on Earth are you doing? </i>Of course, we didn’t know that they were missionaries, or what missionaries did. We had been raised in atheism, in a secular city, in a world that at least pretends to be post-colonial. In all likelihood our parents had deemed evangelicalism—unlike, it is perhaps worth noting, sex or drugs or death—too much for our little light hearts to understand.</p><p>*</p><p>The Foreign Missions Club was a giant building, institution-like, with rows of windows suggesting uniform rooms. It was surrounded by protective rows of bushes, and had an entrance with a small parking space. Its name was painted across its front in large capital letters. The strangest thing about it was that it was so close to our house, and on a leafy street surrounded by other completely normal, coherent scenes: a two-story house with fancy cars in the driveway; a pair of council estates with people and dogs playing in the courtyard; a church, not much used; a bench where a certain homeless drunk liked to sit and talk to no one. This all made sense, and it bored us. It was what we saw on our way to the park every day. The Foreign Missions Club was also on the way to the park, but every day it was something different.</p><p>Approaching it, scampering along, we would turn and look at each other and say: <i>This could be it.</i> Part of the joke was that one day the missions would turn on us because they had found out that we had been spying on them. What exactly they would do was, like everything else, unclear. The reason why it was funny was that we knew they would never do it. We knew from the way they looked at us when we laughed at them, crouching behind a bush, whispering what I’m sure sounded to them like “missionary” and not “mission,” that we had the one-up. For kids, that was a priceless thrill.</p><p>*</p><p>Years later I came back to find that the Foreign Missions Club had drably rebranded; it was no longer called the Foreign Missions Club, but The Highbury Center. Everything about this was wrong. Highbury is the name of my neighbourhood, and the Foreign Missions Club’s new name therefore appeared to be claiming some kind of relevance, even centrality, within the community. How could that be, though, when everything about the building was bizarre, secretive, incongruous with its surroundings? The other problem was the new name’s neutrality. <i>The Highbury Center</i> could have been anything: a doctor’s clinic, a youth center, an office of the local government.</p><p>What the Foreign Missions Club actually was — what it still is — is a hotel for missionaries. There was a time when evangelical protestant missionary workers could stay there for free; these days they get a discounted price. It was and continues to be advertised as a place of respite for all those who fall on the evangelical spectrum: Christian aid workers, doctors working in mission hospitals, as well as the old-fashioned types whose sole mission is to spread the gospel. A few times I have considered going in to ask a few questions in a friendly, neighbourhood sort of way. But I doubt I’ll ever do it. Our joke with the Foreign Missions Club was always doomed to be a one-sided game.</p>","2013-8-24","[311, 596, 737, 718, 521, 409, 714, 607, 30, 331]"

</em></p><p>In October 1866, the editors of <em>The</em> <i>Harvard Advocate</i> decided it was time to address the subject of “love poetry.” Though the publication had been running for under a year, it had already disappointed dozens of swooning sonneteers with rejection letters. In the column reprinted above, the editors do their best to soothe these romantic spirits: it’s not you, they promise—it’s love that’s the problem. A timeless preoccupation, a “favorite” since ancient times, love (they say) is simply impossible to transcribe onto the pages of an undergraduate publication.</p><p><span id=""more-181""></span></p><p>The editors explain that love is an intricate and many-sided thing; however, they regret to announce, its best sides have already been taken. And while it is indisputably interesting, love is not contagious: those who remain outside of Cupid’s sway do not care to hear from his arrow-struck victims. Ultimately, the column concludes, a love sonnet simply doesn’t belong in a magazine. Removed from its proper home—a romantic landscape furnished with gentle whispering winds and twinkling stars—the poem loses its power, only to be obscured by crumbs of ash in the hands of some “careless Sophomore.” The editors recommend that their inspired contributors tone down the love bit and just write good poetry.</p><p>The editors of 1866 can relax in their graves; their concerns have been largely obviated by the passing of time. Today’s poetic climate has shifted away from outpourings of love in iambic pentameter, and not too many rosy-cheeked lads remain sulking over their rejected sonnets for Sally. But to reveal how <i>Advocate</i> editors throughout the decades have treated the matter of meritorious love poetry, I leave you with two representative poems: “The Undying” from 1905 and “Poem” from 1955.</p>{{67 alignnone}}<p><em>Published in </em>The Harvard Advocate<em>, Vol. LXXIX, No. 6 (May 12, 1905). </em></p>{{93 alignnone}}<p><em>Published in</em> The Harvard Advocate<em>, Vol. CXXIX, No. 3 (Christmas 1955). </em></p>","2012-11-6","[617, 113, 560, 409, 467, 518, 91, 157]"
"The Harvard Advocate Hosts Dan Chiasson & David Ferry","[24]","11","Kevin Hong \’15","{{46}}<p><em>On Saturday, November 3, Dan Chiasson and David Ferry read from their poetry and answered audience questions at the Advocate building on 21 South Street. The following is an event reflection by Advocate</em> <em>poetry board </em><em>member, Kevin Hong ’15. </em></p><p>“I actually died six weeks ago,” David Ferry said at lunch.</p><p>We were sharing a combination platter at Café Algiers—Ferry, Dan Chiasson, and members of <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>. Ferry explained that his heart had stopped for a minute at a Brookline restaurant before a doctor resuscitated him. Chiasson’s brow furrowed and his eyes softened as Ferry went on: he returned to the restaurant to find out the name of the person who had saved him, and having obtained a name, wrote a “heartrendingly beautiful” letter to the man. (“Longhand?” Chiasson asked, impressed. Ferry is vivacious but admits to his physical frailty.)</p><p>“But they gave me the wrong name!” Ferry said. Chiasson covered his reddening face in his hands and laughed.</p><p>There was a certain warmth between the two poets, arising from years of mutual interest and understanding. Chiasson’s second book, <em>Natural History</em>, is intended to be in dialogue with Ferry’s translations of Horace. Ferry has touted Chiasson’s critical essays, admiring his close attention to both line and sentence. At the reading, Ferry joked, “I’m so glad to finally have the chance to read with my former roommate,” and Chiasson flashed his Amherst College belt.</p><p><span id=""more-205""></span></p><p>Remarkable similarities link these men: both went to Amherst, both received graduate degrees at Harvard University, and both taught at Wellesley College (Chiasson is now associate professor there, and Ferry is a professor emeritus). Chiasson published in the <i>Advocate</i> in 2011<sup>,</sup> while Ferry’s poem had appeared in the <em>Advocate</em> back in 1957<sup>.</sup> Both, on Saturday, November 3, rekindled their relationships with 21 South Street.</p><p>Ferry delivered his roommate punch line and Chiasson bent over double. I’ll remember that image. In my mind, David Ferry has acquired the mythic status that his own work explores: Ferry’s brief foray into the underworld echoes Orpheus’s engagement with hell, a frequent subject in Ferry’s most recent book, <em>Bewilderment</em>.</p><p>“I bring no messages from the underworld,” he said at lunch.</p><p>While Ferry’s poetry looks ahead and below into the abyss, Chiasson’s looks back towards his own childhood. Chiasson read from the manuscript of his upcoming book, <em>Bicentennial</em>. The title is taken from the 1976 celebration of America’s birthday, which Chiasson recalls with the cool remove characteristic of his verse. His distant voice is most effective in poems about his father, whom he never knew. The poems are littered with what little knowledge the poet could gather up from his father’s obituaries. In “One on One,” Chiasson reflects on their relationships’ core of absence:</p><p><em>I thought we had agreed to play. I thought you said<br/>
We’d play and play all day, beating and being beaten,<br/>
Taking turns at losing learning its advantages</em></p><p><em>for a young man’s character, then changing fates.<br/>
What kind of game is this, your going away forever,<br/>
sending word, years later, that you’d died?</em></p><p>Chiasson’s verse creates an absence that belies a repressed bitterness and a nostalgia for things past—for the final absence. The bemused and slightly affected speaker reveals his continual bewilderment. His colloquial tone, through repetition and subtle wordplay, slowly gathers momentum before leaping into a higher emotional register. In “Star Catcher,” Chiasson laments the innocent ecstasy of childhood that is at once wonderful and inane:</p><p><em>The logic of loss, we could all understand:<br/>
Every fan trusts that losing is barter.<br/>
Though we wanted to die when the Yankees won,</em></p><p><em>We knew that all losers eventually win,<br/>
Every drowned brother results in another:<br/>
As the plane goes, so goes Thurman Munson.</em></p>{{117 alignnone size-large}}<p>The younger poet’s cool and composed reading is in many ways diametrically opposed to that of Ferry, who followed Chiasson with a group of poems from <em>Bewilderment</em>. Chiasson engaged with his audience with poise and detachment. Ferry’s words are an affective plea for understanding:</p><p><em>Among the living the body can do so sometimes,</em><br/>
<em>But the mind, constricted, inhibited by its ancestral</em><br/>
<em>Knowledge of final separation, holds back,</em><br/>
<em>Unable to complete what it wanted to say.</em></p><p><em>What is your name that I can call you by?</em></p><p>- “Resemblance”</p>{{4 alignnone size-large}}<p>Kay Ryan has said that if you put an ice cube on your palm, your palm turns pink because the chill attracts your blood. Poetry functions in the same way: its chill brings a reader’s emotions to the surface. Dan Chiasson may practice these poetics of restraint, but Ferry does not subscribe to the same school. It was clear, as I watched him read, that he was possessed and enlivened by his verse. The poet’s voice was insistent and vigorous. Fear, confusion, and love were made palpable in the poet’s unshakeable lines.</p><p>In <em>Bewilderment</em>, Ferry acknowledges his age and puts his feelers out into the unknown. He probes the spaces between human beings and the void of loss. Like torches in a cave, his lines burn brightly, providing what little light he has in his search for the divine, his confrontation of “the big joke.” And in Ferry there is always room for humor: in “Found Single-line Poems,” he inserts the subtitle, “Playing With My Self.”</p>{{31 alignnone size-large}}<p>I left the building last Saturday invigorated and a little dazed by these two very different poets from two generations: one looking back and one looking beyond, one cool and one warm, one who references his childhood as a lost time, and one who invokes classical mythology to recover lost time. Dan Chiasson and David Ferry, after the reading, did agree on one notion evoked in Ferry’s poem, “Brunswick, Maine, Early Winter, 2000″:</p><p>“It is a connoisseurship of the word;<br/>
Philology is that venerable art</p><p>That asks one thing above all other things:<br/>
Read slowly, slowly. It is a goldsmith’s art,</p><p>Looking before and after, cautiously;<br/>

It does not easily get anything done.”</p>","2012-11-7","[228, 45, 560, 743, 117, 409, 431, 157, 463]"

I bought a cork board and did it at home.</p><p>I found that as I brought my foci closer the ellipse would move toward its ideal self, the circle. From the misshapen amorphous thing to perfect radial symmetry. I liked that. I liked how even shapes acknowledged the worth of closeness.</p><p>And as they moved apart it became more and more difficult to draw the ellipse around them, because it was hard to keep the string above the pushpins, and it left me only with a few ugly, unconnected scratches. Once the sum of the distances between the foci equaled the length of the string it was all over — all I had was a point, closer to one focus, maybe, than the other, forgetting what it was to be an ellipse, forgetting how that felt, what it meant. The foci were naked, then. Where were their shells?</p><p>I forgot about the compass. I was getting older, and I forgot about the compass.

I couldn’t have known it then but that was the moment we decided not to move closer, the moment we decided to stay an ellipse, flatter even than we had been. Maintaining the flatness would hurt, I thought, but it would hurt less than the sharp explosion of a circle, the puncturing of something real and whole. The ellipse would whimper when it split. The circle would scream.</p><p>We went back inside. I to one room and you to another, and I didn’t come find you, and you didn’t come find me, and we didn’t find each other.

"From the Archives: Djuna Barnes","[2, 17]","11","Liza Batkin ’15","<p>“Reading Djuna Barnes is like reading a foreign language, which you understand,” said Marianne Moore about her friend and contemporary near the end of Barnes’s career. “The Perfect Murder,” printed by <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> in its 1942 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Issue, exemplifies the curious linguistic prowess that Moore praises. In fact, the study of “foreign [languages], which you understand” is the very occupation of Barnes’s protagonist, Professor Anatol Profax, a dialectologist (specialist of tongues). A crossbreed between <em>Middlemarch</em>’s intellectually stubborn Casaubon and Baudelaire’s voyeuristic flaneurs, Profax harbors his cherished work in the crook of his elbow as he haunts the streets with a removed aspect and attentive ears. He records the “figures of speech and preferred exclamations in all walks of life” in order to classify species of speakers. He <i>bunch-indexes</i> (Barnes’s term) the inarticulate of England, France, and America as “<i>The Inveterates</i>” and devises other groupings—among them “<i>Excitable Spinsters</i>” and “<i>The Impulsive</i>”—along lines of fanaticism, eloquence, and verbosity. Profax’s scrupulous science literalizes what Moore recognized as Barnes’s genius: she paid close attention to the subtleties of expression, and did not underestimate the potential of a single language to spawn multitudinous variations.</p><p>Djuna Barnes lived first in Greenwich Village, and then in Paris, during both cities’ bohemian heydays. It was in Paris that she became acquainted with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, like-minded contemporaries who together heralded the rise of the avant-garde. By the time “The Perfect Murder,” her last published story, appeared in <i>The Harvard Advocate</i> in 1942, Barnes was an established author. Her reputation at the time (at least within the <i>Advocate</i>) can be surmised from her inclusion in the anniversary issue, which the editors dedicated to “new material from the important figures in literature today.”</p><p><span id=""more-884""></span></p>{{150 aligncenter size-full}}<p> </p>{{20 aligncenter size-full}}{{47 aligncenter size-full}}{{11 aligncenter size-full}}<p> </p><p>By the time she wrote “The Perfect Murder,” Barnes had evidently honed her quirky voice and experimental aesthetic. The story reaches its surrealist climax when Professor Profax meets the “Elephant Woman.” What might become a romantic affair spirals into a scene of absurdity. Profax is preoccupied with the woman’s lips, but only insofar as they articulate a language that transcends his categorical science. She speaks in paradox and nonsense: “I’m a little knock-kneed … and I want to be good.” The Elephant Woman is extraordinary, an aberrant speaker, like none Profax has met or studied. But rather than cherish his discovery of a beautiful outlier, he draws a slit through her throat and so firmly delineates the categories of his dialectology. Having done the deed, the stubborn tongue-academic realizes that has forgotten to learn the single word that would have distinguished the woman from his other human specimens: her name. In the end, Professor Profax remains regretfully unchanged, regarding his human subject as a scientist would, from “behind the mists of … two sheets of glass.”</p><p>In reference to <em>Nightwood</em>, one of her most renowned works, T. S. Eliot commended that Barnes’s “prose has the prose rhythm that is prose style, and the musical pattern which is not that of verse.” Djuna Barnes’s peculiar rhythm and musicality shines through in “The Perfect Murder,” whose ethereal “Elephant Woman” seems at times to speak in a nonsensical logic guided by sound alone: “It makes all the difference in the world. I am as aboveboard as the devil. I’d like some caramels.” Statements like this, delicious despite their incomprehensibility, pervade the text, contributing to the specific and mildly foreign effect of Barnes’s prose. We must wonder about the romantic escapades of Djuna Barnes; clearly she, following in the footsteps of her Professor Profax, made a “Mistress of Sound.”</p><p> </p>","2013-4-17","[617, 492, 211, 409, 498, 518, 4, 605, 417]"

But we just see isolated, presently glowing dots.</p><p>What happens when humans are put into this position, made into reflective surfaces that claim foreign light as their own, masking its historical origin? In an extreme case, we get the events of <i>The Shining</i>, Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 psychological-horror movie based on a Steven King novel by the same name.</p><p><span id=""more-1100""></span></p><p>In the movie, the titular concept of shining is explained as a form of telepathy between certain people and places. Danny Tarrance, a child whose father (Jack) agrees to be winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, has “the shine”: he can communicate with others telepathically, and he regularly receives visions and information from Tony, the “little boy who lives inside his mouth.” As a child, he’s naturally impressionable, and because of Tony, who takes shine and plants it directly in his head, he’s especially receptive to outside influence.</p><p>The main source of that influence is the Overlook Hotel, which converts shining from mere telepathy into a complete infiltration of characters’ identities. The Overlook does not just present the past; it inserts it into inhabitants’ present ideological states of mind. The Overlook is permeated with the histories of individuals (like the Grady family members, psychotically murderous and brutally murdered) and of the collective (like those celebrating at the Fourth of July ball that Jack finds himself a part of).</p><p>But the significance of the shine is not that it exists, nor that it scares people. Rather, it’s important because of how it affects Jack, who embraces it to the point that he becomes it. While the Overlook shows Danny the corpses of potential playmates (the creepy twin girls) and threatens his safety, causing him to retreat into himself in fear, it shows Jack to the warmths of a bar and a ball, welcoming him to do its homicidal bidding. His environment absorbs him into its history, and he brings the Overlook’s history into his family’s reality. All of time becomes compressed, and Jack’s immediate present as caretaker becomes his historical and future reality. He has always been the caretaker of the Overlook and he will be for ever and ever and ever. But only because the structure around him has its particular past, and because Jack is such a reflective surface for its shine. With Jack to carry on its legacy, the shine itself barely matters anymore. Especially not to Jack’s wife, Wendy, who can’t even see the shine early enough to attribute Jack’s behavior to it, and cares only that she and Danny are about to be murdered.</p><p>Which brings us back to the original point. There is a phenomenon I like to refer to as the Cultural Shining. It’s the process by which an individual — perhaps parallel to Jack in his adoption of the shine — shapes her cultural identity around nostalgia for times she has accessed through artistic fragments, but never actually experienced. Passion for the past becomes inspiration, and new creation comes out of it, making a never-ending chain of decontextualized shine. Yes, this is how we achieve artistic conversation across time, and it’s gorgeous. But even more interesting are the decapitated allusions that arise when a Wendy comes along, unaware of sources and their contexts, which become inconsequential. It amazes me that when this occurs, a reference that arose as a pure shaving of time, summoned to stir its source’s substance into that of a new creation, is so easily drained of meaning. It is freed from the very grips of history that made it interesting enough for someone to adopt it.</p><p>Kubrick understood the intrigue of a referent-less reference; some of the most iconic scenes are also the most ambiguous. The point at which Jack cracked. Torrents of blood pouring from the elevators. The woman in room 237. And these are the horrors, the uncertainties, that keep me awake on a sunlit night.</p>","2013-8-30","[311, 721, 596, 734, 409, 373, 100, 577, 699, 352, 183, 552, 522, 274, 358]"
"The Literazzi, or, How David Foster Wallace Broke My Heart","[5]","11","Maia Silber ’17","{{161 aligncenter}}<p>In the dining room, the tour guide holds up each piece of sterling silver and China kitchenware: “This was the fork Frederick Douglass ate with, this is the cup Frederick Douglass drank from, this is the knife with which he spread his butter…”</p><p>The tour, like most tours of writers’ houses I have been on, has the essence of E-bay sales of Paris Hilton’s old pillowcases, paparazzi crooning “<em>Who </em>are you wearing?” as they finger the brocade hems of stars’ dresses on the red carpet.</p><p>It seems strange that literary figures can evoke that type of reverence when literary culture so often sets itself up in direct contrast to popular culture, the higher arts condemning the very pillars of materialism, superficiality, and anti-intellectualism on which celebrity worship rests.</p><p>Yet hours after scorning Douglass’s kitchenware, I am engaged deep in the bowels of the Internet with an investigation of less culinary but equally superficial aspects of David Foster Wallace’s personal life. I had stepped off the path of his fictional work into a forest of <em>Paris Review </em>interviews and <em>Guardian </em>articles about suicide, addiction, and, as I discovered that night, a tumultuous love life.</p><p>What concerned me that night was David Foster Wallace’s relationship with Mary Karr, a poet and confessional memoirist. The <em>Paris Review </em>“Art of Memoir” interview of Mary Karr introduces the two writers’ romance before mentioning Karr’s seminal work, <em>The Liars Club.</em></p><p>I learn that Mary Karr and David Foster Wallace met in rehab in the early nineties. I learn that David Foster Wallace had a tattoo of Karr’s name on his arm and once called her father to ask his permission to marry her. I learn, in a <em>Slate.com </em>article significantly trashier than the <em>Paris Review </em>piece, that their relationship was “destructive.” I learn that, Wallace sent a letter to the head of his halfway house apologizing for considering buying a gun to murder Karr’s soon-to-be-divorced husband (a document uncovered by D.T. Max and summarized, Buzzfeed-ized, and most-likely libel-ized in a <em>Rolling Stone </em>article titled “Six Things You Didn’t Know about David Foster Wallace). I read a poem by Karr about Wallace’s death called “Suicide’s Note” that contains the line, “you asked/ that I breathe into your lungs like the soprano in the opera/ I loved so my ghost might inhabit you.”</p><p>On the same night, I read a crueler meditation on Wallace’s death in the form of Bret Easton Ellis’s April 2012 tweets. <em>Vanity Fair labels </em>the tweets, in which BEE calls DFW “insufferable,” “needy”, “overrated,” and “lusting for a kind of awful greatness,” a “one-sided duke-out between Brett Easton Ellis and the ghost of David Foster Wallace.” Gerald Howard, who worked with both writers, provides analysis in an interview with the <em>Upworthy-</em>esque title “I Know Why Bret Easton Ellis Hates David Foster Wallace.”</p><p>Later, I finish the last few essays in <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again, </em>and read several Mary Karr poems. Neither my critical nor emotional understanding of the pieces is enhanced by these newfound facts.</p><p>David Foster Wallace has written his own meditation on celebrity fascination, an essay titled “How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart,” about his tennis idol’s auto-biography, <em>Beyond Center Court</em>. In it, Wallace theorizes “top athletes are compelling because they embody the comparison-based achievement we Americans revere—fast<em>est, </em>strong<em>est</em>—and because they do so in a totally unambiguous way.” The desire to immerse oneself in the personal life of a sports celebrity via biography and interview comes from a deeper wish to “know how it feels, inside, to be both beautiful and best.”</p><p>But the fascination with literary celebrities seems to be of an entirely different sort. We do not seek to know what was going on in Hemingway’s mind when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, but what was going on in his mind while he slowly drunk himself to death on the streets of Pamplona and Paris, what was going on in his mind when he placed a shotgun in his mouth. We are fascinated by Fitzgerald’s destructive (no quotation marks there) marriage with Zelda, Lord Byron’s bisexual promiscuity. Though the writers we revere might be the best in their genres, we obsess over the failings of their personal lives—their addictions, their extramarital affairs and unhealthy relationships, their suicides.</p><p>In this way, the fascination with literary celebrity also differs from the fascination with popular celebrity—the catchphrase of the latter being “They’re just like us!” Paris Hilton’s old pillowcases are sold on E-bay because someone actually wants to use them, maybe to somehow absorb her essence through her dandruff. <em>People </em>readers want to dress like celebrities and be like celebrities, or else they want the celebrities to fall to their level (paparazzi seek out underwear revealed in limo exits and flabby beach bodies). When a celebrity does something worse than undergo a wardrobe disaster or party too hard, she often fades into the background like a once-beloved uncle no longer mentioned at Thanksgiving dinners. Comebacks are possible, but they must be triumphs.</p><p>Writers, as they slip into debauchery, often only garner our favor. Last September, a nonfiction book called <em>The Trip to Echo Spring: On Writers and Drinking</em>, profiled six famous literary figures and alcoholics: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Williams, Berryman, Cheever, and Carver. It is a popular belief, even, that writers derive their genius from their addictions and their mental illnesses; the Lost Generation’s alcoholism, Woolf’s depression, even the Beatle’s experiments with LSD are said to have been essential to the production of their art. Proponents of this belief tend to ignore that Fitzgerald struggled to finish novels when most debilitated by alcohol, and that the famously straight-laced George Saunders—a trained geophysicist who describes himself in a <em>GQ </em>profile as “a pretty nice guy”– produces some of the best fiction today.</p><p>Perhaps the association of illness and tragedy with genius, and the subsequent obsession with the personal illnesses and tragedies of literary celebrities, comes from the Romantic conflation of poetic inspiration with madness, the type of spontaneity that can be produced by sudden mood swings or drug-induced highs.</p><p>But this alone does not explain the fascination with literary celebrity. If David Foster Wallace’s depression and addiction was only seen as a necessary condition for the genius of his work, why read about his depression and addiction rather than read his work itself?</p><p>Reading is usually lauded for the escape it provides from the mundanity of daily life, but this escape is often one into danger and tragedy. In Anacostia I lean against the bare walls of the gift shop, rereading the passage in <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass </em>where Douglass overpowers the brutal slave-master who tries to tie his legs together; the page reflects on the tour guide’s lenses as he explains to my father how to back out of the parking lot for the third time.</p><p>The escapism of reading is a way for us to experience the thrill of danger and the heart-pangs of tragedy without the grief and the repercussions and the physical pain. For us to climb the whole emotional scale of life while our greatest ecstasy is a sip of coffee and our greatest pain is losing the page.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with the tragedy of real literary figures is an extension of that; a desire to experience the darkest aspects of the world but only second-handedly, through those who will undergo pain most intensely and convey it back to us most effectively. We want the suffering and scandal that we read about in books to be meaningful, and therefore real, but not so real as to enter our own lives.</p><p>I close the page about Karr and Wallace and turn off the bedside lamp. The lights of suburban D.C. shine through the windows of the guest bedroom in my grandparents’ apartment, and I am comfortable and warm. Illness, tragedy, and pain bury themselves below me, not unwelcome monsters under the bed.</p>","2014-10-9","[450, 674, 436, 242, 613]"

"The Harvard Advocate Interviews Martin Amis","[3]","11","","{{192 alignnone}}<p>On October 25, 2012, <em><a href=""http://theharvardadvocate.com"" target=""_blank"">The Harvard Advocate</a> </em>conducted an original interview with English novelist and critic Martin Amis. Amis has published numerous novels and collections of non-fiction, including <em>The Rachel Papers</em>, <em>Money</em>, and <em>London Fields</em>. His most recent book, <em>Lionel Asbo: State of England, </em>was released earlier this year. Below is an excerpt from the interview, the entirety of which will be published in the Advocate’s Winter 2013 print issue.</p><p><span id=""more-126""></span></p><p><strong>The Harvard Advocate:</strong> Do you have any thoughts about the cultivation of writers? Should it be a collective activity? Should some people not become writers?</p><p><strong>Martin Amis:</strong> Well, it can’t be a cooperative activity. Writing is about solitude. To be a writer you have to not only have an enormous appetite for solitude, but you have to be in some sense most alive when alone. I think that’s why, for instance, dramatic arts is probably much lower-level than fiction and poetry—because it is collaborative. I couldn’t imagine any compromise on having total say. The novelist is in a godlike relation to what he creates. He’s omnipotent, omniscient…he’s autocratic.</p><p><strong>The Harvard Advocate:</strong> Could you talk some more about your thinking process as you begin a novel, its gestation stages, and then how you move from that to the final product?</p><p><strong>Martin Amis:</strong> The key is that a novel has to begin with some strange <i>frisson</i>, a shiver or throb, and you think, ‘This is a novel I can write,’ and you do need to have that—and it’s a very peculiar feeling. And then it can be sort of hardly anything, it could be derisory what this premonitory shiver gives you…Maybe just a situation, maybe just a single character. Then you start writing and see what happens. And usually you have an idea of the beginning, an idea of the end, and an idea of something that happens mid-way through. And that’s probably all you’ve got as you start. So it’s a journey without a map, but with a kind of destination. And then it’s a huge exercise in trial and error and multiple decisions, multiple decisions on every page, until you get close to your kind of platonic ideal of what the novel could have been when it first struck you. But it’s an incremental process. It’s brick upon brick.</p><p><em>Photo courtesy of <a href=""http://www.martinamisweb.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.martinamisweb.com</a>.</em></p>","2012-11-2","[348, 22, 560, 409, 467, 498, 163]"

"From the Archives: Navel-Gazing","[2, 19]","11","Isaac Dayno ’15","{{88 aligncenter}}<p>The winter issue of the one hundred and twenty-seventh volume of the <i>Harvard Advocate</i> features six artworks, all of them photographs. The last of the six, printed on the last page, rises upward out of the magazine, monumental in form and content.</p><p><span id=""more-1175""></span></p><p>The midday sun of the photograph divides the stone into distinct and overlapping geometries, the shadows reaching downward to draw apart granite from sky. In the glare the grain speckles the surface with a constellation of pits and grooves. Three long triangles slice downward, as if above some unseen force has driven stakes deep into the frame. Blunted, tapering columns surge into the remaining space; what they support is unclear. The photographer has composed this shot with care, taking pains to decontextualize the object and revel in its form. Like a photograph of a naked torso, it is difficult to reconstruct a head and legs, though the imagination does so anyway. Narrative pulls back from the subject in the photograph’s framing, giving the viewer nothing more than a sunlit pile of cut stone. The dramatic lighting of the granite surface at the lower left and the interlocking forms at the top of the frame all gesture toward a visual abstraction, and though the slabs are composed of abstract elements, the piece remains grounded, perhaps chained, in its materiality.</p><p style=""text-align:center;""> *</p><p>This photograph, like the five other photographs in the issue, is not identified further than its maker and medium. The list of contents reads, “Hilary Hanson… 32… <i>Photograph</i>,” as if “<i>Photograph</i>” is all that is needed to represent or explain this piece as a work of art. What Hanson might have intended beyond an investigation into geometry and exercise in form is uncertain. And even the sculpted and assembled stones of her photograph appear jumbled, as if a child created Stonehenge from collage. However enigmatic and otherworldly and decontextualized Hanson’s photographic subject appears, this tower of stones places itself closer to the center of experience than a viewer might imagine. It is, in fact, the center.</p><p><i>Omphalos</i>, installed at the heart of Harvard Square in 1985 by former Chair of Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies Dimitiri Hadzi, takes its name from the stones that once marked the centers, or navels, of the ancient world. Constructed as a crowning piece of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority’s “Arts on the Line,” the sculpture marks an effort to “humanize” Boston’s transportation and recast it in the vein of that of Paris or Moscow. <i>Omphalos </i>records a moment heavy with anxieties of American cultural inferiority but also hopeful in urban renewal. That hope, however, seems to have come to an end. An upper section of the twenty-foot sculpture recently deposited a thousand-pound piece of itself onto the sidewalk and the MBTA has slated its destruction for the end of September.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">*</p><p>Hanson’s photograph reveals itself to be, ultimately, an act of mimesis. The camera flattens sculpture and grafts it onto the page. Art creates art. Looking through my own photographs of Harvard from my first fall in Cambridge, I discover that I, too, have taken a picture of <i>Omphalos</i>. Shadow, again, plays over the granite pilasters while the scale of the sculpture is impossible to divine. It is not a particularly striking photograph; it will not make its way into the pages of an arts and letters publication. But its existence informs something of its origin. Perhaps the value of the center of the world between the pavement that splits Mass. Ave. is not so much its artistic merit or ability to “humanize” space, but to find its way into the lenses and pages of those who pass.</p>{{26 }}","2013-9-27","[617, 603, 596, 26, 108, 372, 409, 540, 12, 548, 43, 415]"

"Sinister Jesters","[16]","11","Liza Batkin, ’15","{{157}}<p>In the Bokonon religion of Kurt Vonnegut’s <i>Cat’s Cradle</i>, “humanity is organized into teams.” Such a team is called a <i>karass</i> and, unlike other groups to which someone belongs—a university, country, family—a person’s <i>karass</i> is rarely perceptible, even to himself. Rather than a shared place or characteristic, one’s <i>karass</i> pivots around a <i>wampeter</i>, a unifying theme or purpose. As I understand it, <i>karass</i>es exist in something like <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>’s “fourth-dimension,” where truths invisible to us three-dimensioned Earthlings become apparent.</p><p>Reading <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> this winter, I was struck by its resemblance to David Foster Wallace’s <i>Infinite Jest</i>. My curiosity grew when I could find almost no evidence that Wallace had recognized Vonnegut’s influence (please correct me if you can). The unacknowledged resemblance dares me to take a leap of Bokononist faith and propose that the two authors, unbeknownst to them, might have belonged to the same <i>karass.</i></p><p><i><span id=""more-500""></span></i></p><p>In a minor parallel, both writers have posthumously returned to the bookstores in the past year—Kurt Vonnegut with his recently published collection of letters, and David Foster Wallace with <i>Both Flesh and Not</i>. In a review of <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/books/review/kurt-vonneguts-letters.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vonnegut: Letters</a>, Kurt Andersen identifies an affinity between Vonnegut and Wallace in their respective suicide attempts, Wallace’s devastatingly successful. While Vonnegut did not die in 1984 when he tried to take his own life, he did in 2007, a year before Wallace’s attempt succeeded. Andersen describes Wallace as Vonnegut’s descendant, the “younger generation’s depressed and singular countercultural literary superstar.”</p>{{176}}<p>While David Foster Wallace and Kurt Vonnegut may well be literary relatives, their <i>wampeter</i> runs deeper than a bond of depression and countercultural achievement. It is worth noting some broad correspondences between <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> and <i>Infinite Jest</i>, both of which take place in the brief calm after an apocalyptic storm—Vonnegut’s, historical; Wallace’s, futuristic. <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> is set after the bombing of Hiroshima; <i>Infinite Jest</i>, after an event that leaves much of Canada and some of North America (now “O.N.A.N”) a toxic wasteland. In addition to these global cataclysms, both novels are preceded by deaths of a smaller scale. Before <i>Cat’s Cradle</i> begins, Felix Hoenikker, the inventor of the atomic bomb and ice-nine—a chemical that freezes you dead at first touch—dies from his latter invention. He leaves his children, Angela, Frank and Newt (a dwarf), bereft of their enigmatic and fatally creative father. Before <i>Infinite Jest</i> begins, James Orin Incandenza, a prolific filmmaker whose repertoire included “Infinite Jest”—a motion picture that leaves you dead at first viewing—blows himself up in a jerry-rigged microwave. His leaves his children, Hal, Orin and Mario (a dwarf), bereft of their enigmatic and fatally creative father.</p><p><i>Cat’s Cradle</i> and <i>Infinite Jest</i> also feature spiritual gurus (Bokonon; Lyle), superlatively beautiful women (Mona Aamos Monzano; Joelle) and invented vocabularies (Vonnegut designs terminology for Bokononism; Wallace churns out anagrams to typify his futuristic, subsidized America).</p><p>What unites Vonnegut and Wallace in my mind, however, is not <i>what</i> they wrote about (eerily similar though it may be) but <i>how</i> they wrote it. Both writers, despite their dark biographies and fictional landscapes, succeeded in portraying the grim and bleak with humor and humanity. D. T. Max quotes David Foster Wallace in his <i>New Yorker</i> article, “<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/09/090309fa_fact_max?currentPage=2"" target=""_blank"">The Unfinished</a>”: “Really good fiction could have as dark a worldview as it wished, but it’d find a way both to depict this world and to illuminate the possibilities for being alive and human in it.” Vonnegut may have been more expressive of his pessimism than Wallace; indeed it was Vonnegut who <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/kurt-vonneguts-8-tips-on-how-to-write-a-great-story/255401/"" target=""_blank"">instructed the aspiring writer</a> to “make awful things happen” to his story’s characters, and Vonnegut’s own life—marked by his mother’s suicide on Mother’s Day in 1944 and his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden a year later— seems at times as though it were plotted with this instruction in mind. Like Wallace, however, Vonnegut wielded an unerring sense of humor; with this, he, too, illuminated within a world however bleak “the possibilities for being alive and human.”</p>{{170}}<p>Vonnegut’s and Wallace’s characters treat bluntly and jestingly their own misfortunes, to darkly humorous effect. In Cat’s Cradle, Angela, Newt, and Frank take frequent detours as they recount to the narrator the day they discovered their dead father. Before they found him frozen on the porch, they came across a dishrag that had met the same fate; Newt describes that it “reminded [him] right away of Mother’s reticule, of how the reticule felt,” and Angela “explains sentimentally that when a child, Newt had treasured his mother’s gold reticule.” Yet there is no equivalently sentimental explanation of Newt’s next discovery: that, along with their dog, their “father was stiff, too.” The children and narrator then proceed to confront yet another victim of ice-nine, Papa Monzano, whom they hide in a closet in order to “simplify the tableau” of his hospital room. The humor in the scene, and throughout the novel, lies in the dissonance between subject and description: a dead body is rhetorically added to a dead dishrag and dog, and another is hidden in the closet as an object no more valuable than a man-sized mop.</p><p>This dissonant humor surfaces in <i>Infinite Jest</i> as well, perhaps most strikingly in the scene parallel to that in <i>Cat’s Cradle</i>. Orin calls Hal to discuss their father’s suicide, and Hal is only disturbed by the conversation insofar as it distracts him from his nail- clipping. After revealing that he was the one to find his father’s wrecked body, he proceeds to describe his tactic: “the clippers are poised, blades on either side of the nail.” Later, when he explains the physics of the death, he compares his father’s head to a potato, asking Orin if he has ever “baked a potato in a microwave oven?” and did he know why “you have to cut the potato open before you turn the oven on?”</p><p>For many philosophers, humor is borne of incongruity. According to Schopenhauer, “the cause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been thought through it in some relation.” In the scenes I describe, laughter is invoked by precisely this incongruity: the concept of death is intimately related, in both context and association, to such objects as a dishrag, a reticule, a dog, a tableau, nail-clippings, and a baked-potato. The dissonance between weighty actuality and light description is humorous; that those who lightly describe the weighty actuality are those who should be most heavily affected by it, is unsettling. Biographies and plot aside, it is Vonnegut’s and Wallace’s dark sense of humor, their eye for the incongruities in life, for the yang of despair’s yin, that unite the two writers in a formidable <i>karass</i>.</p><p><!--more--></p>","2013-1-24","[516, 440, 361, 674, 492, 409, 663, 495, 404, 518]"

I have lapsed<i> </i>indefinitely into squirreling out minute observations instead of, you know, actually writing. Surely, I think, any detail that alights on my finely-tuned consciousness will also prove itself a Chekhovian story-germ.

I am too agitated, I reason onto my blank unlined notebook, by this fresh crack in the widening gulf between my expectations and reality to possibly write anything now.

"Toni Morrison on Good and Evil","[16]","11","Colton Valentine ’16","<p>“I’ve never been interested or impressed by evil itself, but I have been confounded by how attractive it is to others, and stunned by the attention given to its every whisper, its every shout. Evil has a blockbuster audience, while goodness lurks backstage.”</p><p>-Toni Morrison</p><p>Such was the gilded tone and subject matter that enthralled attendees of Morrison’s Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard last week, in a talk entitled, “Goodness: Altruism and the Literary Imagination.” While she began by detailing a moving instance of human altruism and her resulting investigation into its scientific routes, Morrison quickly turned her attention to how goodness and its antithesis are represented in literature. Her thesis focused on the worrisome obsession with “evil” in modern texts: a fixation that, she claimed, renders wickedness in great complexity and depth. Good, on the other hand, finds only superficial representation. It is too often depicted as merely bland or insipid, a sort of tasteless water to evil’s enthralling blood.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see the manifestations of Morrison’s claim in a broader cultural landscape. Serial killers form the basis for everything from films to scholarly investigation; Jokers, rather than Batmans, tend to be the subjects of our analyses and imitations. We want to understand how someone could want to watch the world burn. Plus, there’s seductiveness in the wicked: it’s both lascivious and enigmatic, threatening and empowering. When otherwise controlled, collected people hedonistically belt out lyrics to Rihanna’s “Disturbia” or revel in one of Macbeth’s harrowing soliloquies, they’re not simply performing. To say “I feel like a monster” is to enter and construct an alternate, perhaps emancipating, identity.</p><p>Yet the application of Morrison’s theory to literature, in particular her own, initially troubled me. She decries the literary overuse of evil; yet vileness is so often found at the core of her novels. Consider the opening lines to <i>Paradise</i>: “They shoot the white girl first. With the rest they can take their time.” Or the scene in <i>The Bluest Eye, </i>legendary for its beauty and horror, when Cholly violates his daughter Pecola. Surely these atrocities must be considered evil? And then there are the societal cruelties in Morrison’s works: the soil that eviscerates both marigolds and Pecola; the community in <i>Beloved</i> that cannibalistically turns on Baby Suggs; the overwhelming specter of slavery that haunts Morrison’s texts so fiercely and  frequently. What I love about her novels is that they neither shy away from these villainies nor depict them in simplistic terms. To do the first would be idealistic; to do the second would be unwise. Evil is complex, and as an enemy, it first must be respected in order to be repelled. Morrison’s characters and texts seem to realize this, so why did her lecture reject it?</p><p>Perhaps, in fact, it did not. While the starkness of Morrison’s labels might encourage a binary approach towards her own and others’ novels—as rendering <em>either</em> good <em>or</em> evil—I believe this is precisely the interpretive style she seeks to rebuff. True, Morrison’s novels may often sing of wickedness, but each horror seems harmonized with a tenacious, vibrant good, a virtue or honesty that explicitly asserts a resonant voice. Morrison does not seek to censor or discount evil, but instead to elevate and elaborate its more comely counterpart. After all, the veritable queen of the open text—she who explores the “how” rather than the “why” in <i>The Bluest Eye</i> or places a literally indecipherable inscription on an oven as the central symbol in <i>Paradise</i>—would seem amiss in returning to the 19<sup>th</sup> century tradition of permitting goodness to invariably triumph.</p><p>I’m reminded here of a quotation from another of my favorite authors, Salman Rushdie, who says of the novel, “It is not an arena to revere; it claims no special rights except the right to be the stage upon which the great debates of society can be conducted.” Morrison, too, seems to advocate “no special rights” in her texts, no synthetic plot construction that permits the absolute victory of virtue. Indeed, she mounts these “great debates,” continually layering her narratives with the intricacies and complications that scald like embers and impel her readers to construct their own fiery discourses. What, then, does Morrison want of goodness? No more and no less than a role on “the stage,” a pulpit from which to speak, and, perhaps, to enthrall. That is, if it can find words with the elegance and majesty of Morrison’s own.</p>","2012-12-14","[516, 581, 560, 569, 257, 409, 83, 498, 396, 127]"

"Return","[16]","11","Victoria Baena \’14","<p>It was the age of Thomas Pynchon and the <em>nouveau roman. </em>Italo Calvino was beginning to map out his invisible cities. And in Paris, in 1963, the Argentine émigré Julio Cortázar added his novel <em>Rayuela</em>—“Hopscotch”—to a jagged landscape of literary experimentation. Cortázar was born in Brussels, grew up in Buenos Aires, lived in Paris for thirty years. Scholars string him in or between the webs of modernism, surrealism, and magical realism. His work is perhaps in, but not of, them all.</p><p>The first story I read by Cortázar was called “The Continuity of the Parks.” In it a man settles into a green velvet chair to read another story, in which a woman and her lover plot to kill her husband. At the end the lover enters the living room of the house to kill the husband. He finds him sitting with his back to the door, reading a short story in a green velvet chair.</p><p><span id=""more-47""></span></p><p>This kind of intellectual playfulness is characteristic of the author. It serves partly as a framework for Cortázar’s metaphysics in <em>Rayuela</em>, his placement of paradise as attainable only diagonally, almost accidentally (in Argentine hopscotch, you move from Earth to Heaven). It is also supposed to suggest the possibility of infinite readings. <em>Rayuela </em>is not one but two novels: the first can be read straight through, ignoring 55 “expendable” chapters at the end; the second by following a map provided by the author, “hopscotch-ing” through all the chapters for a different story.</p><p>Cortázar gives several meta-winks to the reader, nudging him in the right experimental direction. There is a point when Horacio Oliveira, the protagonist, is collecting scraps of drafts for a book by Morelli, an aging author. He worries aloud that he has upset the order of the novel. Morelli says that it doesn’t much matter howthe book is read; it is left to the reader to decide.</p><p><em>Rayuela </em>asks, really demands, the reader to actively participate in the writing and reading of the story. Some readers, Cortázar insinuates—the <em>lector hembra, </em>or “female reader”—will be content to read straight through, adhering to safe traditional linearity. It was clear to me which one I would rather be. Is a book still experimental, when the author provides such clear signposts for the experiment? Even if these signposts point to nothing more than the slanted meaning of a chalked-out children’s game?</p><p>Cortázar asks much of the reader but also hands much to him: beckoning him into his worldview, folding him into the contours of his cosmology. He zooms in easily from the infinite to the infinitesimal. He has an ear for colloquial <em>porteño </em>Spanish unmatched by anyone I’ve read before; if the streams of consciousness and endless philosophizing can be a bit much, their pitch, at least, is perfect. But I had to ask myself, reading <em>Rayuela, </em>how much the spiraling experimentation is meant to augment a straightforward narrative of exile and return—or, perhaps, to conceal it.</p><p>It would obviously be a mistake to equate Cortázar’s biography with his work. But I can’t help but wonder if such a brilliant mind (and he was, undoubtedly, brilliant) struggled to deal with themes close to his heart but hardened, almost, into a pastiche of exile—difficult to crack open under the layers of cliché.  So the hopscotch-ing chapters and the endless sentences and Joycean streams could be distilled, ultimately, into a catalogue of what it is like to be homeless. Which is, finally, ambiguous and experimental. It is a state of mind and place that can perhaps only be ordered into diagonal, splintered meaning—making meaning itself, perhaps, no more than an experiment.</p><p>By Victoria Baena ’14</p>","2012-10-7","[516, 583, 560, 589, 409, 543, 390, 402, 64]"
"Habit: Pulsing Lights","[20]","3","My Ngoc To ’14","{{177 aligncenter size-full}}<p>On cold, snowy days, I like to lie in my bed, wrapped up in my blankets as if I were in a womb, and stare at the lights suspended above me. I wanted my bed to be home for me, a most special place to return to, so I turned it into a nest. I strung Christmas lights above my bed and then made a hung a canopy beneath the lights using my old, dark brown sheets. At night, when only the Christmas lights are turned on, the ceiling above resembles a constellation in the night sky.</p><p>There is a string of lights which did not make it above the canopy. It ascends from the socket and up the wall, towards the ceiling before it disappears behind the sheets. From far away the lights resemble dozens of fireflies, frozen in motion.</p><p><span id=""more-800""></span></p><p>The other day, I was just lying in bed with my glasses off. I purposefully take away my vision when I do not want to focus on anything in particular. I like to know that I can choose when I want to participate in the world. My gaze shifted to the string of lights—they had lost their pointed shape and become floating spheres of light, with a bright core and a fading halo at the edges.</p><p>My body felt like it was floating on the sheets, and my eyes were just seeing and not staring at anything in particular. I began to lose my sense of time when I suddenly realized that the lights were pulsing.</p><p>The halos were expanding and shrinking repeatedly. Each time the white core grew in intensity and caused the sphere to increase to about twice its size. Soon afterwards, it would shrink temporarily, and then burst out again in fits, first after a short pause, and then a longer pause. A thought came to my mind—could it be that the lights were pulsating at the same rhythm as my heart? Could it be that with each pump, the extra blood flow to my eyes made the cells more receptive to light?</p><p>I put my hand above my heart and listened, watching the lights as I felt for my pulse. It was indeed true! The lights were pulsating along with the rhythm of my heart. I stayed like this for a few more minutes. The lights dilated more with the systole and less so with the diastole.</p><p>After a few minutes, I threw myself under the covers, hiding from this spectacular. I could not believe this was truly happening. I thought of the blood gushing into my eyeballs, washing over each and every cell behind my retina. This was a breakthrough, I thought. I needed to see for myself if this was actually true, so I crawled out of the covers again and continued staring at the lights. After a few seconds, once my eyes had managed to unfocused their gaze, the little balls stared moving again. It was the same pattern, ceaselessly repeating itself to a heart which never fails.</p><p><em>Illustration by Alejandra Dean ’13</em></p>","2013-3-15","[133, 596, 515, 629, 560, 645, 133, 409, 173, 531, 594, 65]"

"The Real Meaning of Comfort Food","[5]","11","Faye Zhang, ’17","{{137 aligncenter}}<p>So I make a quick check of Yelp—these ribs better be quality ribs—and run out to the recommended rib joint on River Street named “Coast Cafe” and make my purchase: three whole pork BBQ ribs with a side of collard greens and string beans (to be healthy). When my order comes, it comes nestled in a styrofoam box, embraced by two pieces of aluminum foil. The heat sweats through the box and the plastic happy face’d bag.<span id=""more-1479""></span></p><p>When the box pops open, there it is: the meat tar glistening, fat smacking, heaven smelling rack of ribs that’s been waiting in the promised land.</p><p>Comfort food has existed for at least as long as fire and probably before (Mongol warriors stored raw mutton meat under their saddles as a quick pick-me-up snack—and invented steak tartare. Not long after came the chopped steak, and then the hamburger).</p><p>But what makes comfort food so comforting? Is it their hit-all combination of fat, sugar, and salt? Is it their connection with childhood memories? Louis Szathmary, the late Hungarian-American celebrity chef, theorized that men love hamburgers because the buns remind them of the maternal bosom. Whatever the “it” factor, we all recognize and are drawn to cues such as the sizzle of meat, the crackling of fries in oil, the sweetness of cream, and the carb-y heft of bread.</p><p>More interesting, however, is the question of what comfort food, well, comforts. The pure physical reasons we are drawn to comfort food involves its nutritional makeup. We crave carbs and fat as our body’s most readily used form of energy. It’s no coincidence that ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs)—products meant to treat severe malnutrition—often contain calorie dense peanuts, whole milk, and sugar.</p><p>Perhaps it is also not a coincidence Colonel (Harland) Sanders began doling out fried chicken dinners in front of a gas station in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression. By 1938, Sanders went so far as to sponsor “relief banquets” for families on welfare; one imagines his chicken featured prominently. And then there are advertisements hawking products such as ice cream and french fries, screaming their ability to make people happy, loved, or even sexy. Something about comfort food goes deeper than mere bones and muscles.</p><p>The city of Cambridge’s great proliferation of educational institutions often mask the fact that it is a real city with residents who aren’t temporary collegiate settlers, and that the only available food isn’t from wood-paneled college dining halls. To dig deeper into the true meaning of comfort food in this city, we must venture beyond salad bars and serving trays and into the messy, gritty streets. As of 2012, 14.4% of all persons and 9.9% of families in Cambridge live below the poverty line. Historically, many of these people lived in an area known as “Area Four” (formerly a landfill), bordered on the north by Hampshire Street, on the south by Massachusetts Avenue, on the west by Prospect Street, and on the east by the Grand Junction Railroad tracks.</p><p>Coast Cafe, the Yelp-recommended rib joint, is located in Area Four. The “Coast” in the name refers to a now little-known moniker for the southern half of Area Four. No one is sure how Area Four got this nickname. Perhaps it is because the area bordered the Charles River. Or perhaps it is an ironic allusion to the upper crust East Coast college kids next door. One may never know the origin of the name, but perhaps we may guess at the origin of the food.</p><p>Boiled down to the bare bones, comfort food is poor man’s food—in all cultures. Cheap, easy-to-make, and above all, filling, dishes ranging from macaroni and cheese to meatloaf to fried rice both warmed the body and allowed thrifty cooks to use scraps from previous meals. Emotional connotations would have been quick to follow. Fullness equaled security. Security equaled comfort equaled love. Perhaps Szathmary’s assertions about the maternal bosom aren’t so farfetched; after all, the most idyllic childhood memories are centered around baking a warm, yeasty loaf of bread with mom.</p><p>Perhaps comfort food can never be fully explained. Its essence encompasses a myriad of textures and tastes: fat, salt, sugar, umami, creamy, slippery. It feeds all of our primal needs. But there is that mysterious way in which mere food—made of dead (or nearly dead) ingredients—can so easily transcend the physical and deeply affect the social and emotional realm. What happens in between?</p><p>That’s something to think about. But at the moment, my ape brain is wholly occupied by the steaming meal in front of me. I gnaw on the ribs, holding the ends with my bare hands. The thick meat sticks nicely between my teeth, the tendons crackle, and the syrupy barbecue glaze slithers between my lips. And the only word I think, or rather feel, is content.</p>","2014-9-21","[450, 525, 205, 273]"

"Fever: The Smile Hotel","[7]","2","Zoë Hitzig ’15","<p>The air conditioner was broken in my tiny room at the Smile Hotel. Even two hundred miles north of Tokyo, the late-July heat could smother you if you asked.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">*</p><p>By day, I left my room to work for the two people I worked for. By night, I went to dinner with the two people I worked for before returning to my room. They were paying my expenses and gave me a small stipend, for which I was grateful, et cetera.</p><p>One night I left dinner early and not undramatically. It’s difficult to faze me, but once I am fazed I tend to stay fuming, the offender’s existence becoming a personal affront to my own. I ran back to my room and, sweltering, stripped naked in the six-inch wide strip of floor space between desk and bed. I looked to my right, into the mirror above the desk that extended nine inches from the wall on a good day. I wanted to see a face blistered with anger, scorched with fury. But the yellow light of the room had soaked into my skin. My features were razed the way <i>purikura </i>makes eyes bigger, limbs thinner, skin smoother until each person who steps into the photobooth walks out looking like the one that came before. My likeness said <i>arigatou gozaimasu! </i>like everyone said to everyone else.</p><p><span id=""more-384""></span></p><p>I flung myself prone on the bed. It didn’t give, so it hurt, refusing me the solace of sleep. The door and opposing window wanted to kiss and crush me lengthwise. The sheets, already damp with sweat, wanted to drown or hang me—they had yet to decide. I opened the lusty window, but what played outside was equally churlish. The fumes of <i>yakitori </i>snaked through my window, seeping into whatever space had been left for me.</p><p>Jaundiced, tense, and hot, I called my boyfriend, who was lounging somewhere between Greece and the Canary Islands. He didn’t pick up but I spoke to him anyway and left my laptop open on my bed just in case he might Skype me back. I put my moist right cheek on the keyboard: the finger grease of years past seemed safer than the buckwheat bean-filled pillow in cahoots with the sheets.</p><p>I heard a knock on the door but didn’t rise to open it. The man I worked for appeared anyway on the flimsy desk, sitting with his legs wide open. He was also naked and sweating. I closed my eyes but that changed nothing. He methodically swept the circumference of his nostrils with his left pinky, drinking his <i>shiro</i> wine straight out of the bottle. He used my hotel phone to make a call in Japanese. He inflated, loomed larger with each sip of wine. When the conversation was over, his head was touching the eight-foot tall ceiling and his belly nearly reached the opposite wall. He slammed the hotel phone back onto the cradle and continued to swill and swell.</p><p>The hotel phone rang. The man tossed it to me. I grasped it with my clammy hands, unspeaking. I heard the man’s voice through the receiver, apologizing, maybe. I hurled the phone through the open window, managing to avoid the large body in the tiny room. The telephone cord wrapped me up and tied me tight to the base. Led by the receiver and held by the cord and cradle of the hotel phone, I slipped out the window and down four flights. We landed on the bonsai tree outside the flower shop that was only open on Sundays.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">*</p><p>The Smile Hotel shared its lobby with a 7/11 where I sometimes bought chocolate and whiskey. I didn’t deduct from my stipend to buy them, but sometimes I wish I had.</p>","2012-11-27","[542, 560, 165, 651, 35, 532]"
"Aeschylus and the Election","[16]","11","Reina Gattuso \’15","<p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">When Robert Kennedy announces at a campaign stop in Indiana that Martin Luther King, Jr. has been assassinated, the crowd lets out a collective scream. I’m viewing a film of the 1968 speech on a late October afternoon in seminar, leaning forward to watch Kennedy’s grainy image. This particular class is about Black liberation movements and canon formation, and we’ve been watching clips of civil rights rhetoric for an hour now. We’re trying to figure out how the living, swelling voices of Black leaders—people previously pushed to the cracks of American culture—can assume the aesthetic authority of a literary novel or anthologized poem. Watching the moment at the peak of the 2012 election season, it feels particularly charged.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">At one point in the speech, Kennedy quotes a line from Aeschylus. As I watch Kennedy grope for the words, the moment shivers through me. Kennedy cites the tragedian as his favorite poet, then pauses, muttering something to himself, maybe mouthing the Greek before pushing its dactyls into the fat marbles of English. His crisp New England clip ripples over the crowd:</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">“And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.</span>”</p><p><span id=""more-302""></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">It’s a moment of intense emotional impact. It’s also a reminder of how the rhetorical register of American political elites has changed. Kennedy gives his speech in response to King’s death—needless to say, an extraordinarily difficult circumstance—yet it’s hard to imagine a contemporary politician quoting Aeschylus at all, even at a similar moment. While perhaps in keeping with the tone of a Harvard man’s 1968 presidential bid, Kennedy speaks with a set of references not evinced on the 2012 campaign trail, where colloquialism and popular allusion rule the day. The title of an August 2012 online <i>Time </i>article proclaims “Obama’s Soaring Rhetoric” to be “A Bright Shining Lie”; Vice President Joe Biden uses and misuses the word “literally” in his DNC speech with the frequency of an animated teenager.  Certainly, politicians these days don’t quote Greek poetry. Hearing Kennedy’s speech in late October, a time awash with the frantic punditry of political commentators, I’m struck by the range of rhetoric that somehow forms a culture—from Aeschylus to the sound bites of a Facebook newsfeed.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:medium;"">But when he quotes Aeschylus, Kennedy isn’t talking about abstractions. He is talking about the death of a real man who breathed and believed things; he is groping to find words fit for the scope of a real and immense tragedy, translating not only Greek to English, but loss to language. At a scale this large, with actors this influential, register holds power. Kennedy’s spontaneous eulogy, his dip into the register of intellectual tradition, is an acknowledgment that King has a sanctioned place in the canon of Official History—a history written by rich white men schooled in dead languages. At the same time, the speech acknowledges a renegotiation of who precisely authors this history, and who has the power to enter it. The call to antiquity is not a pivotal baptism canonizing King as public saint: fitting as the words are, King doesn’t need their permission. He walked into history without ever having been invited. </span></p>","2012-11-16","[516, 98, 151, 560, 696, 409, 320, 464, 423, 128]"
"Picture This: Photographic Media in the Harvard Advocate","[2, 19, 22]","11","Ezra Stoller ’15 and Edwin Whitman ’15","<p><em>The history of photography in the Harvard Advocate is an ongoing and rich one, a confrontation of the enduring question: How does the image find its place in a literary magazine? To commemorate the launch of The Harvard Advocate’s Winter 2013 issue, “Origin,” we have traced the emergence and changing role of the image in the Advocate and the ways in which the photographic image has been read on the page.</em></p><p>Although photography had emerged in print in the early twentieth century, photographs only first began to appear in the magazine during the fifties and sixties as illustrative content and as advertisements.  A portrait of T.S. Eliot was included in the centennial issue, used as a visual reference to one of the<i> Advocate’</i>s most esteemed alumni. All of these examples speak to the then secondary, supplementary nature of visual media to the magazine.</p><p><span id=""more-708""></span></p>{{156 aligncenter size-full}}<p>Yet even at this point, photographs were quietly gaining more momentum, energy, and impact.  Photos were featured alongside interviews with literary luminaries such as John Berryman (published in the Spring 1969 issue) and Conrad Aiken (published in the October 1970 issue).</p>{{168 aligncenter size-full}}<p>This particular spread of this October 1970 issue marked a particular moment in the institutional use of the photograph in the<i> Advocate</i>, as the image was now distinguished from the content it had been informing. On this page, the film reel vertically flanks the text of the interview with Aiken. With the sprockets visible, the set of pictures remains raw, and the seriality of the portraits lends a new agency to the photograph, which now tells a story of its own. Rather than being edited, this printed film negative bares it all, without attempting to hide what wasn’t used. Instead, this image embraces the processes that both interviews and photography require.</p><p>These years, between the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, marked a radical transformation in the use of visual media in the<i> Advocate</i>. Photographs began to be published more frequently, though they still often remained as supplemental material. The photographic image had seldom existed by itself. “The Symbol,” published in the Fall 1968 issue, can be seen as the turning point that gave photographs their own voice in the magazine.</p>{{80 aligncenter size-full}}<p>“The Symbol,” a reproduction of a collage of pasted text, was one of the very first images printed on its own without any captioned text. Here, the text becomes the image—the text is the image. The two media coexist and mutually enhance each other, as photography becomes the vehicle through which the poem is reproduced and published. Photography acts as the means for reproduction of a poem of visual ontology. Poetry had prompted the publication of the photograph as a form of its own craft.</p><p>This piece speaks to the growing importance and centrality of photography to the magazine.  The Vietnam War and the revolutionary voice and spirit of student counter-culture of the ‘60s and ‘70s set the mood for the shifting direction of the magazine. James Atlas, 1968 president of the<i> Advocate</i> and current chairman of the Board of Trustees, chuckled as he remembered photographic media emerging in the pages of the magazine. Atlas recalled one particularly edgy photographic cover published in February 1970, describing it as the “nude backside of a woman, that’s a good name for that.”</p>{{140 aligncenter size-full}}<p>Moving on from such levity, Atlas took time to reflect upon the larger role that photographs played during his tenure on the<i> Advocate</i>. His time in college took place within a context of social radicalism, Atlas remembered: “One of the powerful motivations was to be scandalous, not intellectually provocative.” Through the increased inclusion of visual media, he hoped “to somehow have the<i> Advocate,</i> for all its endearing stuffiness, reflect what was happening outside our windows, quite literally.”</p><p>In a literary magazine, the focus often lies on the words. Text tends to frame images, through captioning, explaining, and contextualizing. The then-racy 1970 cover of the magazine of the bare backside of a woman speaks to the ways in which the photographic image can color how something is read.</p><p>Beginning with the renegade spirit that helped photographs gain steady footing as an integral part of the publication, visual media in the<i> Advocate</i> have since continued to evolve. They remain a part of the rich artistic tradition that the magazine continues to publish today. In the Winter 2013 “Origin” issue, “Ellen’s Gift” is a parafiction, a photo essay that operates in the space between fiction and reality, that poses as if it documented the story of a real woman. Current photographs in the <i>Advocate</i> have found their contemporary edge.</p><p>In meditating upon visual media in the <i>Magazine</i>, it seems only fitting to honor 1932 president James Agee, renowned American art critic and media theorist. In 1972, a commemorative issue to James Agee was published that highlighted his theoretical works on visual media.</p>{{125 aligncenter size-full}}<p>Photography at the time was still relatively new in the <i>Advocate</i>’s institutional memory. Agee had written extensively about the photograph and the ways in which the viewer comes to appreciate its meaning. In reference to a Walker Evans photograph, taken when he was writing <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, Agee writes about the struggle of verbally discussing and analyzing photographs. For him, “The whole problem, if [he] were trying fully to embody the house, would be to tell of it exactly in its ordinary terms.” To caption a photo limits the photograph’s possibility, reducing it explicitly to a lowest common denominator; something is inevitably lost. An ineffable photographic effect remains that cannot be put down on paper.</p>{{60 aligncenter size-full}}<p>Agee’s discussion exposes the underlying irony of any analytical exploration of photographic material. This short piece serves as a footnote to photographic highlights of the past. But perhaps, this series of ‘explanations’ dilutes the possible potency of visual media in the<i> Advocate </i>itself.</p><p>Is a picture worth a thousand words? Or should a picture simply leave us speechless?</p><p>Let us blink, and with fresh eyes, savor the silence.</p>","2013-3-2","[617, 603, 271, 726, 149, 139, 467, 654, 16, 298, 526, 31, 415, 605, 438, 349]"

The apartment is in a high rise of rental condominiums overlooking the beach, two blocks from a retirement community.

The furniture is sparse; a stationary bike fills the space where a couch would sit.

How I know she is old is I tell someone to guess her age, and then add ten years to whatever number they give. No one is surprised by what I say. She could be as old as one hundred and five.</p><p>“Let’s cut a deal,” she tells the doctors. “I’ll stop the surgeries. You put in one that <em>lasts</em> this time.”</p><p>She is on her third ACL in the left knee alone; the latest installment is still in its wrapping.

"Persian Sonnets: A Translation of Rumi","[10]","11","Roxanna Haghighat ’15
With thanks to Leslie Dunton-Downer, a trustee of The Harvard Advocate, for reviewing the translation.
","{{39 alignnone size-full}}<p><em>Mowlānā Jalāl al-Din Muhammad Rumi, also known simply as Rumi, was the preeminent Sufi mystic and poet. Born in 13<sup>th</sup>-century Persia, he composed a wide variety of poems about the themes of sacred love, beauty, and the eternal longing to be united with the Divine. In addition to the </em>Masnavi<em>, his revered six-volume poem, Rumi is most famous for his </em>Divân-e Shams-e Tabrizi<em>, which includes over 3200 </em>ghazals<em>. </em></p><p><em>The </em>ghazal<em> is a form of traditional Persian poetry that is often compared to the Western sonnet, due to its strict formalistic requirements. In the original Farsi, a </em>ghazal<em> comprises five to fifteen couplets, each ending with a refrain, which first appears at the end of both lines of the first couplet. The final couplet usually includes a reference to the poet in the third person, communicating more directly with the reader. Unlike sonnets, however, each couplet remains independent in meaning—a poem in itself—united to the others only in its form, rhyme, and meter. This sonnet from </em>Divân-e Shams-e Tabrizi<em> is widely considered Rumi’s final composition, addressed to his son while on his deathbed in 1273.</em></p><p><span id=""more-489""></span></p><p><b>Go place your head on the pillow, leave me be </b></p><p>Go place your head on the pillow, leave me be,<br/>

Put your fingers on the line of your jaw under your ear, and now move them towards your nose a little. What you are touching under the skin — that tough tissue — those are salivary glands.</p><p>I didn’t know I had salivary glands either until I contracted an infection in Berlin that caused them to swell up like hard balloons. My friend got it first; we were having dinner in our small apartment when she lay down on the ground and stopped moving. We didn’t have a thermometer, so all I knew was that her forehead singed my fingers when I touched it, and that her eyes were kind of blank. But we were sixteen, invincible, broke, and living an adventure in a foreign city. We had no guide book, no Internet, and no knowledge of an equivalent to 911 (nor knowledge that 911 works anywhere). So we got in a cab and told the driver <em>Krankenhaus</em>, and he drove us away into the empty Sunday-night city.</p><p><span id=""more-397""></span>We pulled up at a deserted alley and the driver gave us a look. My friend’s leg felt like a radiator against mine. I didn’t know the word for ER, so I asked for the “quick room.” The driver only shrugged and repeated the fare.</p><p>This particular hospital in Berlin — I still don’t know its name or where it is in the city — looked like a university campus, or a private mental institution, and on this night at least, all the lights were out. My friend couldn’t walk much, so I left her in one place and ran around in the dark.</p><p>I encountered a strange person as I was running and, though I was not the delirious one, I still have a hard time convincing myself he was real. By this time I had remembered the word for ER and pleaded with him three or four times in German and once in English to tell me where it was. He only looked at me blankly, before mimicking me in a high-pitched squeal. Then he ran away.</p><p>It wasn’t long before I saw the glowing sign that read <em>Unfallstation</em>, an oasis in what had become my madness. I sprinted back to fetch my friend and within minutes we were sitting in front of two hypnotically calm German doctors. By this time her face had swelled up to around one and a half times its normal size, and the doctors sat for a while probing her chipmunk cheeks in silence, the only sound the quiet weeping of an old Turkish woman in the corridor. Eventually they prescribed her a medicine that drained us of our last euros. We spent the entirety of the next day lying in a public park, having been kicked out of our apartment at 9am and unable to afford anything else. Our flight — thank God — was scheduled for late that evening.</p><p>The doctors told us that if she hadn’t come in by sunrise the fever would have killed her.</p><p>A few weeks later the sides of my face expanded as hers had done, and I lay in agony, unable to talk or eat, being tended to by my mother. It was an ugly illness, not only in that it had none of the romance or drama of my friend’s, but also in that my face was distorted in such a way that I couldn’t help but cry any time I accidentally saw my reflection.</p><p>Neither the German doctors nor a string of English ones were able to diagnose what it was that we contracted, and neither the expensive drugs we bought at the night pharmacy in Berlin nor the antibiotics I acquired for free from the National Health Service cured it. It simply faded with time, and I have no assurance that it won’t one day come back. So it is now in my nature to touch my face habitually in a superstitious prayer, haunted by that strange sickness, not quite able to believe it was real.</p>","2012-12-4","[542, 459, 560, 165, 409, 714, 180]"
"Hat-Trick: To My Brother Who Has Never Scored A Touchdown","[11]","8","Noah Pisner ’14","{{53 aligncenter}}<p> </p><p>Consider Sisyphus, brushing the dust across his bruised ribs, sighing curselessly as Zeus’s impossible rock thumps again down that clay hill in Corinth. Imagine how the old king takes his time coming down to meet the stone, how the rock must wait while he, without worry, may keep to a gentle descent, even pausing when appropriate to lookout below. Think of the view from the top: the whole world pressed into flatiron plains. There, below are the bluegrass fields where in early October boys run wind sprints past the line between the swing-gate and shed, where cleats catch mud in solemn ritual, and where young rushing bodies smash young rushing bodies and footballs are tucked underarm. There, even farther, is the hill that you and I used ascend every day in autumn, attempting to catch sight of eggs hatching in the chickadees’ nest; and there are the tracks, ridged over lopped stems from the mower that one day minced grass with eggshells. The ridgelines are still there, you’ll see; rain pours through them like slag.</p><p>To prove himself at hero, an Athenian champion once came to Corinth and successfully pushed a boulder up the Sicyonian hill. Only when the rock balanced in place, the Corinthians laughed. To them, the only thing the champion had proven was that the gods didn’t believe he was worthy of being pushed back. Keep an eye out for champions, kid.

"Contemporary Hungarian Literature & The Politics of Repression","[16]","11","","<p style=""text-align:left;""><em>After living in Budapest the summer of 2012, Stephanie Newman reviews two recently released Hungarian works and discusses their relationship to the country’s politics. Newman is the former publisher of the</em> Harvard Advocate.</p>{{105 aligncenter}}<p><b>I. </b></p><p>Housing Works was standing room only on the night in July when Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai sat behind the microphone. I had just arrived back in New York from a five-week stay in Budapest, and I was surprised to see that the SoHo establishment had, at least on this night, become a more fervent mecca of Hungarian literature than Budapest’s own university bookstore. Americans crowded around the author whose reputation as an overseas phenomenon was just starting to gain traction in the United States. From the front of the room, Krasznahorkai discussed his winding syntax and signed copies of his newly translated novel, <i>Satantango. </i>Given that Hungarian books seldom attain an American readership (Hungarian is a grueling language to conquer), the stockpile of Krasznahorkai hardcovers represented a triumph for both the author and his reviewers.</p><p>Moderating the Housing Works discussion was James Wood, the critic largely responsible for introducing Krasznahorkai’s work to an American audience. In July 2011, Wood published a feature in <i>The New Yorker </i>exploring the Hungarian author’s unusual fiction. Casting Krasznahorkai into the literary constellation of avant-gardes Bolaño, Bernhard, Sebald, and Foster Wallace, Wood calls Krasznahorkai “perhaps the strangest” of them all. He identifies the novelist as a craftsman of the long sentence, a visionary who pulls his plots just to the brink of revelation—but never beyond. Krasznahorkai’s impulse toward cataclysm is his most distinctive feature. His three novels available in English—<i>War and War</i>, <i>The Melancholy of Resistance</i>, and <i>Satantango</i>—all describe worlds that brim with foreboding. Characters imagine paranormal manuscripts, a Hungarian village becomes home to a whale’s body, bells ring from no discoverable source. This sense of impending doom in Krasznahorkai’s work led Susan Sontag to call him “master of the apocalypse.”</p><p><span id=""more-821""></span></p><p>Master though he is, Krasznahorkai is not the only luminary on the contemporary Hungarian literature scene. Novelist Péter Nádas, whose <i>Book of Memories </i>also garnered Susan Sontag’s acclaim as “the greatest novel written in our time,” plays an equally vital role in nourishing Hungary’s literary life. Nádas is famous for his 1,000-plus-page novels that entwine multiple narratives into Proustian fabric. His most recent publication is a collection of short stories and essays called <i>Fire &amp; Knowledge</i>. The book is humbler than his novels but no less accomplished. Nádas uses frank observations and tight prose to create the same discomfort that Krasznahorkai invokes with his evasive plots and meandering sentences. Where Krasznahorkai is strange, Nádas is candid. Both authors revitalize a literary culture that is often condemned to international oblivion. Americans reading their works know that somewhere between Budapest’s Hapsburg-style grandeur and post-Communist decay, literature blossoms.</p><p>But beneath Hungary’s cultural topsoil, political tumult rumbles like unstable tectonic plates. This year alone, the autocratic Hungarian government slashed university funding, slurred the European Union (to which Hungary was accepted in 2004), and introduced measures rolling back freedom of press. Legal scholars have disparaged Hungary’s entire new constitution as “unconstitutional,” and after the government violated the independence of Hungary’s central bank, the European Commission put Hungary on trial. The ultra-conservative Fidesz Party, currently controlling Parliament with a two-thirds majority vote, is only the latest installment in a long line of repressive governments. Before Fidesz, Hungary suffered through forty years of Soviet-enforced Communism. Prior to that, the Hungarian Parliament housed the Arrow Cross Party, a German puppet government brutally installed toward the end of World War II. The danger of yet another unchecked government, Hungarian-bred or otherwise, imposes a political continuity that is painful to witness.</p><p>Contemporary Hungarian literature is by necessity a product of the country’s unique political story. It is strange to think that, while Krasznahorkai and Nádas have been praised in America for their formal accomplishments, these writers are rarely discussed as an access point to Hungarian politics. Krasznahorkai, born in 1954, and Nádas, born in 1942, both wrote under the mantle of Communist censorship. Repression leaves their literature with a particular taste, and resonances from Communism and the preceding war echo through their texts. Recognizing the historical tinge in their writing helps us to understand the political past that so vitally orients Hungary’s political present. Beyond aesthetic value, these authors offer precious insight into the history of one of the European Union’s most troubled constituents.</p><p style=""text-align:right;""><a href=""http://stephanienewman.net/2013/03/28/contemporary-hungarian-literature-the-politics-of-repression/"" target=""_blank"">Continue reading “Contemporary Hungarian Literature &amp; The Politics of Repression” here.</a></p>","2013-3-30","[516, 264, 506, 409, 697, 354, 661, 470, 462]"
"Now You See Him: Richard Linklater’s Boyhood","[16]","11","Yen Pham, ’15 ","{{131 }}<p>Imagine that you have a superpower for accelerating time at whim, for making decades pass in the span of hours. Imagine now that your superpower is actually just extreme diligence, and that you are the director Richard Linklater. The product of this is <em>Boyhood</em>, a languorous dip into the formative years of a young boy in suburban Texas and a feat of filmmaking stamina. Its innovation was to film the same cast for a few days out of every year for twelve years, and for a time after seeing it I wondered whether its power rests solely in its gimmick. After all, <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/07/17/boyhood-gets-much-out-its-young-star-and-cinema-itself/yTixjbcHhCCOTKY2b8000I/story.html""><em>The Boston Globe </em></a>had gone so far as to declare that it “may be why the movies were invented.” And yet, what it has to say about boyhood, or parenthood, or generalized personhood, resides squarely in the banal. It is the opposite of Terence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em>, which situates its portrait of Texas boyhood in the context of nothing less than the incipient universe and the beginning of life on Earth. That film opens with a quotation from Job 38:4, 7 (“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? …”) set to John Tavener’s “Funeral Canticle,” and ends with a surrealistic beachscape of the dead. <em>Boyhood</em> opens on a little boy cloud-watching to the strains of Coldplay’s “Yellow,” and ends with him, twelve years later, getting stoned in a national park.</p><p><span id=""more-1471""></span>“Life,” Linklater suggests, is better captured in a representative sampling than in extremes. It’s not your first day of school or even your mom’s second wedding so much as the time your dad took you bowling or the time in elementary school you were coerced into a terrible haircut. <em>Boyhood</em> doesn’t disregard the conventional logic that life rarely resolves organically into a compelling story so much as question whether a film needs a story at all. There are calamities, but they don’t begin to present themselves in the manner of a central quest or tension. The film maintains a tone that is purposely level. Dangers, for the most part, are subtle, and come to nothing. A scene where middle-school Mason (Ellar Coltrane) throws around a saw blade with friends seems destined to end with a skull split open, but doesn’t. In another he looks at a phone for three seconds too long while driving, as if to explain the impending crash that never happens. Still, <em>Boyhood</em> is a minor marvel. It feels like more than the sum of its parts—even though the part where Linklater films the same people over twelve years is clearly indispensable. Ultimately, what distinguishes <em>Boyhood</em> from time-lapse photography is its emotional stakes; what makes it different from novels is its visceral seamlessness. Through its condensed portrait of incremental change, the “gimmick” of time’s passage is anchored to a larger project; <em>Boyhood</em> moves by the inevitability of loss, if not the cunning of plot.</p><p>Multiple critics have suggested a slight disingenuousness to the movie’s title: protagonist Mason seems more an orbiting point for the lives of a whole cast of characters than a definitive central consciousness. Wai Chee Dimock in the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em> called it “steadfastly intersubjective… a crowdsourced modern epic, voluminous and interminable.” We follow Mason as he grows from a thoughtful kid who just wants to know if elves are real into a mellow, floppy-haired teen with his first job and serious girlfriend. But we also follow Mason’s sister Sam (Lorelei Linklater) with near-equal attention until she hits adolescence and leaves for college. We watch Mason’s mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette) as she tries to make a better life for herself and her children. Along the way, she marries first a professor, then a student, both terrible husbands. Though Olivia is depicted mostly in struggling, we see the affable, fly-by-night Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) as his children probably do: with the non-custodial parent’s advantage of having fun time all the time. When he finally trades in the black Pontiac GTO for a baby-friendly minivan, Mason Sr. laments to his now-adult son that things didn’t work out between him and Olivia—he couldn’t be the kind of person he should have been when she needed him to be it. On the one hand, this is merely a reflection on the vicissitudes of time and relationships. And yet, one wonders whether the difference between Olivia and Mason Sr. was really that he wasn’t temperamentally capable growing up then, or if young mothers don’t tend to have a choice.</p><p>The film loosely transplants Linklater’s own boyhood into the experience of growing up in the 2000s, the autobiographic mapped onto the generic. Mason’s family draws heavily on Linklater’s: his parents were also separated; he too was primarily raised by his mom, who went back to school to study psychology when he was a boy. A birthday scene in which Mason receives a shotgun and monogrammed Bible from his step-grandparents corresponds to a real-life Christmas that Linklater calls his “redneck bar mitzvah.” But the film’s temporal identifiers are deliberately universal; there’s a way in which <em>Boyhood</em>‘s banal vision results in a banality of cultural reference. Ellar Coltrane and I share a birth year, and for anyone around our age <em>Boyhood</em> is an uncanny revisiting of pop cultural trivia we absorbed at our most impressionable and subsequently forgot. The soundtrack is a little bit like that feature of Spotify that says, “‘Somebody That I Used to Know’ was huge when you were a teenager. Play now?” Linklater enlisted his two young stars for help choosing the movie’s music, but their adolescent tastes turned out to be too specific: Ellar liked Rage Against the Machine and Lorelei liked harpsichord music. Insofar as <em>Boyhood</em> “happened” to me, it happened to almost every young-ish person in the Western world.</p><p>Linklater is interested in film for its capacity to preserve, but not to indulge the illusion that things never have to change. Rather, in <em>Boyhood</em>, art’s capacity to arrest time actually emphasizes time’s inexorability. It’s unclear whether Mason’s burgeoning love of photography is a stand-in for Linklater’s discovery of filmmaking, but the parallel is apt. The paradox of art plays out in the same way in Mason’s photography as it does in Linklater’s movie. In one scene, Mason and his high school girlfriend visit the University of Texas at Austin together, warm in the revelatory glow of first love. In the next, he dismantles a display of prize-winning photographs he’s taken of her. He lingers over them, we assume with affection, but it turns out to be closer to regret. We realise that their relationship has ended suddenly, bitterly, in the space between. And we are instantly disabused of the idea that successfully suspending something in time is any talisman against mutability.</p><p>The character who addresses the precariousness of time and circumstance most explicitly is Olivia. Her appearances at beginning and end gesture outside <em>Boyhood</em>‘s own temporal bounds. When we first see her, trying to explain to an unsympathetic boyfriend that as a single parent she has certain obligations, she exclaims exasperatedly, “I was somebody’s daughter, and then I was somebody’s fucking mother!” At the film’s close, Mason’s departure for college prompts a tearful reflection on the way life slips away imperceptibly, then stunningly: “Sending Sam off to college, sending you off to college… You know what’s next? Huh? It’s my fucking funeral!” But the moment is precluded from puncturing the film’s general weightlessness by Olivia’s self-consciously comic hysteria and Mason’s response, the unperturbed riposte of youth: “Aren’t you skipping ahead by, like, 40 years?” (He has a point: by the temporal logic of this film, the part where she dies ought to be a solid 10 hours away.)</p><p>This is because <em>Boyhood</em> bears Linklater’s imprint in temperament as well as autobiographical content. As much as is possible for a work of art primarily concerned with the changes—good and bad—wrought by time, <em>Boyhood </em>remains a vehicle for a fundamentally benevolent view of the universe. One minor character occurs and recurs seemingly solely to demonstrate that even the smallest acts of kindness bear life-affirming fruit. Olivia tells a handyman fixing her pipes that he’s too smart not to go to college. Years later, having taken her advice, he reappears with pleasing symmetry as the manager of the upscale restaurant where Mason’s graduation lunch is taking place. But Linklater’s optimism is rendered on a much larger scale, too: given Mason’s itinerant upbringing and the complete dearth of satisfying models of male responsibility, he turns out reassuringly well adjusted and serene. Jesse Barron observed at <a href=""https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/reviews/life-events/""><em>n+1</em></a> that Mason remains “[oddly] unaffected by his own growing up… [he] occasionally looks like a teenager who won a contest in a mall and has been invited to appear on a reality show.” Malcolm Harris at <em>T<a href=""http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/boy-2-man/"">he</a></em><a href=""http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/boy-2-man/""> <em>New Inquiry</em></a> criticized it as Linklater lacking the courage of his own portents; in the troubled landscape of contemporary American boyhood, with its “foreshadows of violence and cruelty… Linklater declares victory too early.” It’s certainly possible that individuals could have Mason’s childhood and not be damaged by it. But its cherry-picking of the most popular of pop culture suggests that in some way it seeks to be a topography of communal experience, too, and in that regard it falls short.</p><p>Still, I’m more sympathetic to <em>Boyhood</em>‘s approach. Linklater is, after all, the director who made <em>Dazed and Confused</em> and <em>School of Rock</em>, the consummate cineaste of goofy stoner philosophizing, and he wants you to have a good time. It’s a film of many pleasures: consistently funnier than a good deal of comedies, it provides an affectionate and naturalistic rendering of its characters, especially children. Though Olivia’s outburst near the film’s end presents us with mortality, we aren’t allowed to linger on it too long. Instead, we are swept away by Mason’s enthusiasm as he savours his first taste of the freedoms that college brings. <em>Boyhood</em> depicts loss and change because that’s what life is like. But in Linklater’s universe that only adds to the beauty of it all, as he burnishes to high shine memories we might otherwise discount.</p><p> </p>","2014-8-30","[516, 442, 456, 366, 273, 263]"
"Fever: Off a Cliff","[7]","2","Sarah Hopkinson ’13","<p>The weather in Scotland is far from feverish. Clouds bristle, bulging in flocks along the tops of barren peaks. Houses and lampposts are swept into grey shadows. People grow smaller as they walk along the streets. Limbs fold in on themselves to brace against the rain. I used to imagine the sullen inhabitants of grey brick houses being swallowed up by their stone floors and heavy wood doors. I remember how harsh accents would rip the wind in my ears.</p><p>I am eight years old and am standing on the edge of a beach in Eastern Scotland. Cliffs cut harshly into rough sea. The sky is low, oppressive. I am wearing lime green leggings and small white trainers. The trainers used to flash brightly when slammed down, but now they only flicker wanly. I am trying to revive them, slamming my heels roughly on the pebbled beach. The heels remain white. My brother is standing next to me, skinny, his buoyancy repressed by the cold wind. He clutches his oversized coat around his frame and stares glumly out over the water. We do not talk.  It smells of burned rubber, the clammy sharpness of salt. Noises, frisky and anxious, emanate from the car a few meters behind us, from my parents standing beside it. They have lost a map. My dad has lost a map—my mum is saying—although it is just as likely it was her.</p><p><span id=""more-392""></span></p><p>My parents conclude, locate the map, and are upon us. They rustle us up and we set out along the empty beach. Up ahead I see amorphous, white shapes clustered along the beach. I don’t ask what they are. I look out at the grey sea, and back again to the forms growing ever more distinct. At once my brother begins to run, his coat flapping behind him. I look up at my parents but neither of them say anything. My dad smiles gently at me. I turn back to the beach. My brother has become just another blue stain against a field of white.</p><p>As we walk, the shapes become nebulous forms. I see that the white is flesh, large globules of jellied flesh. Long tendrils stream like fingers from the forms. The tendrils are wrapped up in themselves, in rocks, pieces of driftwood, empty coca cola cans. Some have been gashed upon the rocks, and their bodies splay outwards like broken corn. There are hundreds: they coat the beach.</p><p>My brother stops at the edge of the expanse. He looks curiously at the bodies and begins to poke gently at one with the edge of his shoe. My parents and I stop too. My mum looks sharply over at my brother. “William, stop that!”</p><p>The pathetic white globules nauseate me, with their flopping arms and gargantuan heads. But their nakedness makes my own flesh burn with anger. I keep looking but feel the heat rise up in me and begin to flare. I turn abruptly away from the massacred bodies and stare out over the ocean instead. I watch as a small bird rises on the wind. Its feathers are grey, but its wings are like fragile porcelain. Suddenly, the bird dives towards the ocean and resurfaces with something clasped in its jaws. It is a glazed, grey fish, thrashing violently.</p>","2012-12-3","[542, 226, 560, 165, 409, 13, 355]"

The friend I’m staying with is one of those people, and she translates for me, telling him I’m interested in sexuality, that I study it at school, that we can talk. We talk and drink along the cobblestoned main drag lining the bay, the two of them feeling good in their irreverence—drinking beer midday during Ramadan—hair tousled by the Aegean breeze. The promenade resembles the center of a European city, Milan maybe, but smaller, less organized, less shining-clean, with the feeling that something has fallen through the cracks.</p><p>I ask him, “What is it like here?” The friend I am visiting translates.</p><p>“It’s bad,” he says.</p><p><span id=""more-525""></span></p><p>The days in this city are still, too heavy, punctuated only by the calls from the minarets, sounds that twine through the air in braided harmonies, and the motion of the sea.</p><p>“Really I want to leave.

I tell him about someone I heard speak once who didn’t know there was such a thing as lesbian until she was a teenager and saw one on Oprah, and how then everything she felt made sense.</p><p>He tells me about a popular Turkish TV soap opera with a gay subplot, a guy in love with his boss who comes out about it in the last episode. It’s as unrequited as his own crush was on a middle school classmate, he tells me, and on the first boy he kissed, last week.</p><p>“It’s always the gay subplots,” I say.</p><p>We have another beer each and talk about people we used to be in love with, and pretty soon there are hugs and tears and we’re sitting there by the garbage-studded ocean eating bad quesadillas and weeping into the twist of minaret-sound, into the hoot of the ferry crossing the bay.  I’m leaving in a couple days, heading back to Istanbul, then flying to Massachusetts where I can marry whom I please.

The way you read it is interesting, too, because it’s hard to pin down. Can you talk about what kind of tone this is — eerie, nostalgic?</p><p>Robbie Eginton: I’ve never really tried. The story is as it always is, and the giant is in some kind of space where he’s aware to some degree of Jack’s perfidy, and yet he is able to sit down with Jack. He has some kind of power. Beyond that, the giant doesn’t need to physically threaten Jack, he doesn’t need to yell … he’s just putting Jack through this communication. I don’t know if I can piece apart why he feels motivated to say the things he says. But he needs, to some degree, to have this connection with the person who he’s trying to kill, who’s going to kill him or who has killed him. There’s also a power that comes with being in this out-of-time space and being the only one with a voice.</p><p>KH: On one hand, the poem is a threat, yet it also becomes a kind of confessional, strangely intimate. The giant doesn’t portray himself in the best light; he admits the grotesqueness of his actions. It’s interesting what you say about needing to connect because the connection is at once a threat — I need to get to you, you better watch out — but also I’m trying to <i>get to you</i>.</p><p>RE: In a sense, the thing that I’m threatening you with is connection. I want you to be emotionally connected, not just profiting off me.</p><p>I think one thing that’s going on is there’s an emphasis on the giant’s profession and his method. For me, the poem is not so much about the morality of these actions; I’m not terribly interested in that. I’m more interested that he makes his living by taking apart other people’s bodies; these others with bodies and habits become unnamed. This is what I’m interested in: when do the motions and shapes of our bodies have meaning, and when do they not?</p><p>KH: Did something about the story prompt you to play with it?</p><p>RE: I was interested in the fringe areas of body, where the body isn’t well-defined. Like dismemberment, things like that … Then I thought, isn’t it odd that the giant says, “Fee, fie, foe, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,” but when has an Englishman come up to the land of the clouds before? How does the giant know what the English smell like? That’s one of the deviations of my version from the standard account; he makes a habit out of grinding Englishmen, changing bodies into bread, or meal, at least,  unnaming them and giving them another name. This is kind of like Ursula K. Le Guin talking about names. If you read the Earthsea books, they have this focus on the “true name.” The name is sort of the form. You can give something a new name and it’ll change that thing’s essence.</p><p>KH: I also love the part where the grinding of the bones turns into bread. There’s the process of obliteration, which is also a transcendent act. Bodies become like a Eucharist, no?</p><p>RE: I hadn’t thought of that. If this were a poetry board meeting, I’d be embarrassed. That’s interesting because I hadn’t thought about the giant’s act as being a <i>creative</i> act. I guess one of the flaws of the poem is that we don’t see where that bread goes. What happens to it? Is the giant the cloud-equivalent of a miller? Except he mills people, small people … <em>(laughs)</em></p><p>KH: There’s also church imagery; the poem takes on an even more religious color.</p><p>RE: It’s definitely playing with that. I just hadn’t made the connection between the bread coming out of the giant’s workshop and the church. With the church, I was thinking more about his ability to see things in terms of higher concepts; I don’t think he’s very good at it. He’s a little bit like the title character in Borges’s “Funes the Memorious.” It’s about this man who, through an accident, develops perfect memory. He has infinite storage and absolute recall. But he loses the ability to think in generalities. Not only can he not understand that multiple dogs are the same species, but he can’t understand that the dog sitting <i>now</i> was the dog shaking its fur one second ago. The giant is not <i>that</i>, but he has a similar trouble — he’s very caught up in his body and the connection that his body has with other bodies. That’s where I was bringing in the church.</p><p>KH: I’m always enraptured by poems that are retellings.</p><p>RE: They’re fun!</p><p>KH: Is that your main mode of writing poetry?</p><p>RE: No, but I don’t want to say if I have one. I’m a young poet. This poem is fairly complete, I feel, but for the most part I’m still trying to maintain a mode where I don’t talk too much about my poetry in general. I can talk about this poem, it’s published, fantastic, but in terms of poetry that I <i>do now</i> I don’t want to say. I don’t want to be thinking about being in interviews and trying to explain things … I don’t want to get in that loop. The point is to write the poems.</p><p>The one thing that I think about “Fum” and a lot of my poems is that circumstances when I was writing it are woven into them. A lot of “Fum” was written in a church, which is why there’s so much church in it. I don’t do a lot of retellings, but I might want to try it again.

When stepping into a frigid room, full of boxes that haven’t been touched by human hands in decades, we feel powerful: we have a secret, a life that will now open up to us as vividly as the yellowed letters and photographs allow. The archive holds an important position in our cultural imagination. For those of us who have never personally sifted through John Keats’s love letters, we experience the soothing and tantalizing nature of the archive through books, movies, and museums.</p><p>But it is the imagined distance of the archive that makes these sensations possible in the first place. The archive has to be far away. We imagine it underground, impeccably clean, and perfectly ordered in long corridors of metal filing cabinets. Too much contact with an archive can feel strange. To be alive among so much dead matter can be uncanny. In <em>Cronos</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s (emphatically unsexy) vampire film, the ailing villain Dieter de la Guardia possesses the archive of an alchemist who, centuries ago, attained eternal life. The creepiest scenes in the film take place in Dieter’s archive-cum-bedroom: an austere and sterile storehouse for dead secrets and the man’s grotesque, cadaverous form. Meanwhile, the protagonist, who has accidentally injected himself with the elixir of life, becomes a bloodthirsty vampire who, though appearing younger and stronger, also shows signs of decomposition. His skin burns in sunlight, and peels off like leaves of yellowed paper. Underneath, his new hide is the color of alabaster. As an undead, he is not ended — and yet, he must sleep in a chest in the attic like a forgotten thing.</p><p>Today, the archive is uncomfortably close. In a hyperbolic flourish, I would like to claim that many of us, documentarians and curators of our own lives, have reached the status of the undead. Like zombies, we pop up in each other’s news feeds and Instagrams. Bilton notes in his article that when he does a Google Image search of ”Nick Bilton,” his ex-wife, by some magical algorithm, pops up. He worries about what relatives and future girlfriends will see when they look at his profile, and laments that Facebook makes it frustratingly hard to get rid of unwanted memories: hundreds of photos and messages must be deleted one at a time. In her article, Buntin writes that since Lea’s biological death, “she’s died again and again…. Facebook has made her death a sort of high-concept horror movie. How many more times will I grieve her? How many more details from my past, from Lea’s past, are buried online, waiting for me to uncover them?” Buntin goes on to describe Lea’s wall, which has turned into a virtual memorial. There is something uncanny about the similarities between communicating to and remembering a friend on Facebook. Social media enacts a leveling process between the living and the dead.</p><p>We face these issues on a grander scale as well. Gopnik observes in “Stones and Bones” that memorial museums exist for the purpose of discovery, preservation, and learning. Holocaust museums, for instance, make public memories that have been rescued from obscurity. In so doing, they “memorialize the dead without becoming macabre.” “What happened on 9/11,” he continues, “by contrast, was a crime deliberately committed in open air as a nightmarish publicity stunt, one already as well documented as any incident in history. We can’t relearn it; we can only relive it.” There is nothing to uncover or piece together. The trauma of the event simply repeats itself: photographs, phone calls, pieces of twisted metal.</p><p>The emergence of the archive isn’t necessarily a bad thing—my allusions to the undead are meant to amuse as much as alarm—but this phenomenon is one we must address. We now live in what Foucault described as “the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed.” We no longer live in the world as beings following trajectories; rather, we live in an ever-blossoming network in which the people and places we engage with constantly overlap. Now that overlapping temporalities and modes of being have emerged, we must come up with new ways to cope, to bury, because the way we humanize the dead speaks volumes about the way we live in the world.</p>","2014-7-28","[450]"

"Habit: The Key to Muscle Memory","[20]","3","Ezra Stoller ’15","<p>My keychain is heavier than it needs to be. As my fingers move from the central loop outwards, keys and knick-knacks gradually become less and less important. On the central loop itself is my dorm key. One loop removed is the key to home in San Francisco, a key to 21 South Street, my CVS ExtraCare card, and a miniature rice bowl keychain I bought last summer in China. If my fingers need to dig any further in my pocket, they eventually will hit a bottle opener and pair of compressible chopsticks. It’s always good to be prepared.</p><p>I realize that my pockets could be much lighter, but the bulk of the keys together makes the keys much harder to lose. I’d rather have too much in my pockets than not enough.</p><p><span id=""more-906""></span></p><p>I keep my wallet in left front pocket, and my phone and keys in front right pocket. As I approach the door, which leads to my entryway, I anticipate and reach into my left pocket for my wallet and turn it so my ID will face the scanner. After entering, I slip my wallet back into its place and immediately take my keys out of my other pocket, making sure they don’t get tangled with my phone. Without looking, I feel for the central loop, and separate my dorm key from the pack and have it turned ninety degrees to enter the keyhole horizontally. I slide it in, its teeth perfectly matching the lock, turn it, and lean in with my body to open the door. As I slip into my room, I tug the key out and by the time I sit down at my desk, my keys are already back in front right pocket.</p><p style=""text-align:center;""> *</p><p>During my last few days at home during spring break, I was walking up the stairs to the front door and my mom, a little behind, carried some groceries. I instinctively went to my pocket and pulled out my keychain, and my fingers felt around the center loop as my hand approached the lock. I pushed the key slightly and met resistance. It didn’t fit. I tried to push again, but had never needed to force it before. My mom looked at me, as I fumbled through my keychain, to the second loop, and found my San Francisco key. As if I had never opened the door before, I looked at key and methodically fit it into the lock. Everything felt different. At home, the key goes in vertically rather than horizontally. I had forgotten that with this old door it is easier to open when you pull the door closer to you as you turn the key. I eventually got it open, and my mom chuckled. I made a mental note to make sure this would not happen again while I was home. For me, it felt like an embarrassing waste of time, and a reminder that I wish I spent more time with family in San Francisco.</p><p>As I left for the airport, everyone else was walking down the stairs to the car in the driveway, and I was responsible for locking the top latch of the front door. I reached into my pocket and felt around for the top loop and raised the key to the lock. It wouldn’t fit. I quickly corrected myself, glad that my mom didn’t see me make the same mistake. We arrived at the airport, said our goodbyes, our I-love-yous and six later, I arrived back at Harvard Square. I made my way to Eliot House, and to my room, and when I reached for my keys as I approached the door, and I raised my hand towards the lock, the key slid in smoothly and my roommate was there to welcome me home.</p><p> </p>","2013-4-22","[133, 139, 133, 409, 101, 489, 689]"
"A Conversation with Charlotte Lieberman","[3]","11","Kiara Barrow \’16","{{72 aligncenter}}<p>Notes from 21 South Street<em> staff writer, Kiara Barrow ’16, talked with Advocate alum, Charlotte Lieberman ’13, to discuss<a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/relationship-advice/college-dating-screwed-up""> her recent article in Cosmopolitan</a> on college dating. In the story, Lieberman describes the symptoms and disease of a pervasive “whoever-cares-less-wins” paradigm, offering an analysis that includes anecdotal, statistical, and literature-based research. In this interview, Lieberman discusses her writing process, her Harvard experiences, and her own strategies for navigating diverse interests and opportunities as a young professional writer. </em></p><p><span id=""more-1375""></span></p><p><strong>Your article offered a different and refreshing angle that resonated with a lot of readers. I was particularly interested in the part where you disagreed with the notion that “hookup culture” is the problem with college dating, which seems to be the angle that many people take.</strong></p><p>I don’t think you can simply diagnose “the problem” by saying that people are hooking up. Up until Hannah Rosin wrote the article “Boys on the Side” in <em>The Atlantic</em> as an off-shoot of her book <em>The End of Men</em>, people weren’t really examining the millennial “hookup culture” phenomenon with a particular focus on how stereotypical ideas of gender dynamics came into play. It was when I read Hannah Rosin, and when I found myself disagreeing with undercurrents in her argument, that I felt propelled to make my argument <em>not</em> about hookup culture. I wanted to think a little more about the emotional terrain of what I was talking about.</p><p><strong>Often, when people write about college dating, it is very gender based; women are either victims, or too much in charge. How did you navigate writing about college dating, without getting too caught up in the misleading and obvious ways in which gender seems to be part of it?</strong></p><p>I certainly identify as an ardent feminist, and living in the Co-op at Harvard—not to give the Co-op all the credit—exposed me to a community of people that was thinking about gender and sexuality way more critically than anyone else I had ever spent time with. I’d say one thing that was extremely difficult was balancing my desire to take advantage of the opportunity to write for a wide audience—<em>Cosmo </em>readers—with my understanding that this wide audience may not want to hear everything that I wanted to say.</p><p>The Hannah Rosin piece and the <em>New York Times</em> feature, “She Can Play that Game, Too,” that came out this past July, both laid out arguments that basically equate sexual liberation for women with the ability to “act like men.” That really didn’t sit well with me. When I sat down and really tried to digest these arguments, it occurred to me that I really wanted to collapse our cultural assumption that emotional vulnerability = weakness. If we continue to perpetuate the assumption that “acting like a man”—in the stereotypical, backward sense—is equivalent to empowerment, we are not going to get anywhere. This assumption still privileges men over women. What we’re fundamentally privileging right now is a patriarchal value system in which being an asshole is empowering, which it’s not.</p><p><strong>I was also wondering about the fact that you talk about Harvard somewhat—you’re clear about where you’re coming from and what your experiences at Harvard were like, but what about this issue is particular to college or Harvard?</strong></p><p>It was a kind of balance, as you point out. <em>Cosmo</em> was interested in the story being about Harvard specifically, but also wanted it to appeal to a wider readership by pointing out arguably “universal” dynamics. And I guess I also don’t think Harvard is that different. That being said, I think the final club culture is a bizarre version of fraternity culture, and it’s bizarre because it has heightened dynamics around privilege and exclusivity attached to it. I should also note that I was actually going to talk about the Advocate in the article, but that seemed way too niche for <em>Cosmo</em>’s readership. Although I think most of the people I dated in college were on the Advocate, including my current boyfriend. I’m happy to admit that to the Advocate blog; I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone.</p><p>To answer your question about college in particular: the thing that sets “college dating” apart is that it’s a microcosm, so everything feels—and is—far more ramped up. College students are living, learning, eating, drinking, and sleeping around each other at all times. So by extension, everyone has the opportunity to be attracted to each other at all times; this creates the opportunity for people to act blasé, or “care less,” as if they have a million things to do all the time—and often, they do. At Harvard, people construct their identities so that they seem very intense in all these different facets of life, and that lends itself to a kind of convenient way of distancing yourself from people. I also think that the intense intellectualism at Harvard is a defense mechanism for so many people, myself included, and I think at the Advocate especially I found that—like, are we on the same page about Proust? We’re flirting because we’re talking about Proust.</p><p><strong>I want to hear about your process of writing and research.</strong></p><p>I started from personal experience and as drafts progressed I kind of created concentric circles of outreach. I sent an email to my close friends, and then my close-ish friends, and people from Harvard, and then people I had met once, and people in my Gmail contacts and then I was sending Facebook messages and having my Facebook status be, “Please reach out if you have a story about someone you were dating using text messages to make you feel insecure.” I did feel a little uncomfortable putting myself out there, but it was productive in the end. I will say that the subject matter really made people feel generous.</p><p>Then, I wanted to find a way to ground my argument with statistical research, something I could build upon with anecdotal research. I interviewed Lisa Wade, who coined the “whoever-cares-less wins” dynamic. She’s a professor at Occidental college. She was really tapping into this idea that acting stoic has been valued because it’s inflected by patriarchal values. And then I referenced a book, <em>Guyland</em>, which I actually read in a class called “Masculinites” in the Harvard WGS department. So the research was personal experience, generalization, asking questions about that generalization, constructing an argument, and then going back to weave in statistical and literature-based research to tie my ideas down into something more concrete.</p><p><strong>Now that you’ve been out of college for a little while, have you noticed things changing in terms of the way these things work? Do people adopt different attitudes once they have started to embark on things outside of Harvard?</strong></p><p>One of the things I miss most about college is constantly being surrounded by people who could be really cool. I’m a freelancer, so I don’t go to an office and I think that makes it feel less omnipresent. That said, I think that almost every single person I know who is living in New York right now is on Tinder or OKCupid, and online dating totally shifts things. It’s complicated because on one hand, the “whoever-cares-less-wins” thing is less of a problem, because everyone is there to meet someone so they’re admitting that they care. On the other hand, everyone can meet a million people in one click of the mouse. So, if they’re on a date with you, and then they don’t get back to you—maybe they’re on another date. There’s so much room for ambiguity that I think it makes the anxiety worse, in a sense.</p><p><strong>I want to hear more about how your writing career is going, and how you’ve made the transition from being a writer at Harvard to entering this new scene. There are so many different expectations about what is it like to have a creative career, what is it like to freelance, and what do you do if you want to write.</strong></p><p>I was put in touch with <em>Cosmo</em> through a connection and got the article by successfully making it through “an audition” of sorts. In the midst of my search for a “normal” 9-5 job, a bunch of other freelance writing opportunities started to accrue. In December, I got an email through the Harvard NYC alumni list from a woman who started a juice cleanse company in Shanghai and they needed an English copywriter. I secretly or not-so-secretly want to do something related to health and wellness at some point in my life, so I talked to her over Skype, and the opportunity totally fell into my lap. Then, while I was on a meditation retreat with my sister over New Year’s, I got another gig with the meditation author Sharon Salzberg working as her editorial assistant. In this sense, “putting myself out there” has really made all the difference.  I think that the main thing I gleaned from these past couple months has been about knowing how to characterize what your interests and skills are. I didn’t expect to make a living from writing, but it’s totally working. I’m not working in a literary environment, but I have my own time for my literary pursuits; I’m still writing tons of poetry, and I’m having my poetry published in April in the <em>Boston Review</em>. If anything, the fact that I’m doing something else gives me space to breathe and pursue it in a personal way. Writing can manifest itself in ways you might not have expected.</p><p><strong>I wanted to come back to what you said about being a feminist, which often seems like a crazy, complicated, challenging idea to be and talk about these days.</strong></p><p>What I’m really interested in doing as a young feminist is being earnest about it. I’m sick of the fact that irony seems to have to accompany anything serious. There’s a way in which the HBO show <em>Girls</em> is really smart, but it’s also extremely sardonic. It’s doing all of this work, but with the many ways that irony is at play it’s hard to even keep track of what’s ironic and what’s not. I think that it’s really important to believe that your ideas are interesting and valid, and therefore be unapologetic, and emotionally vulnerable, about that.</p><p>College gives you a stable environment, but in the world it’s easy to feel like your ideas exist in a vacuum. I didn’t think my article was good before it came out. You always feel insecure about your own work, but now that I have responses I’m excited to feel that I have my own interesting point of view. In the nonfiction world these days there is such a trend of defending your authority on a certain subject, but I think it’s a matter of really owning it. I’m not going to apologize for being a feminist, or say that it’s uncomfortable. I think that an earnest attitude really disarms people, and there’s a risk—but the benefits are super powerful. I’m really interested in representing things about our generation and being honest and emotionally grounded as opposed to always bringing it back to irony and humor. So we’ll see, I’m meeting with this agent on Tuesday and we’re going to try and discuss potential book ideas, because I want to keep up the momentum.</p><p><strong>That’s exciting.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I don’t really have ideas yet, but I will by Tuesday.</p><p> </p>","2014-4-15","[348, 744, 636, 499, 235]"
"Marginalia: Told by an Idiot, Signifying Nothing","[23, 5]","9","Sarah Rosenthal \’15","{{191 }}<p>Letters have started to pool at the bottom of my backpack. The alphabetical kind. They lie on the surface of jagged, shrapnel-like scraps of paper and were once part of The Sound and the Fury. Perhaps the printing house of my edition disliked the book and chose an especially brittle paper for it, knowing it would disintegrate in my hands as I read it. Hundreds of pages fell out and splintered when they should have folded; it seemed like pre-programmed self-destruction happening out of sympathy for the Compson family. I no longer own a copy of The Sound and the Fury.</p><p>But I’ve been carrying around its remains all semester. I sometimes find pieces lodged between leaves in my notebook, or occasionally stuck to my toes while I study. They show up everywhere, clinging to objects I transfer from one bag to another, or leaping into my hair in the process. Every time I put a book, notebook, or object of any other kind into my bag, I further pummel the already tortured fragments that haven’t made a run for it. By the end of the semester, the pool may be indistinguishable from the sand that hitches a ride in my pockets after a weekend retreat.</p><p><span id=""more-1287""></span></p><p>“Hats not unbleached and not hats. In three years I can not wear a hat. I could not. Was. Will there be hats then since I was not and not Harvard then. Where the best of thought Father said clings like dead ivy vines upon old dead brick. Not Harvard then. Not to me, anyway. Again. Sadder than was. Again. Saddest of all. Again.” (95)</p><p>I suspect this isn’t the passage cushioning my notebooks, since none of the scraps I’ve picked out have had traces of underlining. But if not taking up the margin of my backpack, it’s one of the passages I carry in the margins of my thoughts. Not because it strikes me as particularly true; in fact, I find myself with no opinion of Harvard as a gestalt. But the characterization strikes me because I have encountered sadness here — in myself and in others — and a kind of clinging made permanent by rigor mortis onset from repeated deaths. Death is too strong a word. But the idea of death marks the point in this recursive cycle of hope, effort, achievement, and disappointment where amnesia sets in and the next iteration begins. It is the shock of realizing that the goal you reached had little to do with the desire that led you to set it. It is the achievement of a supposed end that shows you how far you are from what you want. It kills you by saying how wrong you were to think this is the answer and by never pointing out that the overarching question is the issue.</p><p>Clinging. To former selves, to simplified value systems, to long-lost social practices, to ideas of what this place should be, and to the idea that validation from one more group will lead to satisfaction. The absence of dissatisfaction when you see whatever it is that you want revives you so you can climb and cling even harder when the next death comes around. It’s a world built on anticipation; on knowing there are so many tomorrows that could give us what we want, and on ignoring that we thought the same of the yesterdays.</p><p>The orts of paper in my backpack are the predecessors to dust, and I cling to them. Dislocated from their source, they have accumulated on a surface I would have no reason to visit, except to clear them away. But they aren’t dust yet, because in my mind, they cling to the sorrows and longing and faults and naiveté that they once carried. They are still a part of The Sound and the Fury, and they still carry those tormented words about Harvard. Maybe I’ve made these morsels into a vehicle for my cynicism about motivations, keeping me aware of the sadness and disappointment that come when your only options are to hang in place or to let go. At least they have given me a view to hold onto.</p><p>I’ll throw out the scraps of paper eventually. But for now I’ll let them sleep in my backpack, which hangs in a building whose walls are old, dead brick.</p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align:left;""><em>By Sarah Rosenthal ’15</em></p>","2013-12-29","[177, 450, 467, 537, 352, 649, 363]"
"Introduction: Compass","[9]","10","James Wood \’14","<p><em>This month, we feature a series of short memoir posts centered on the theme Compass. James Wood ’14 describes our vision for this theme below.</em></p>{{15}}<p>I’ve only been lost in the woods once. Which, I’ve been told, is more times than most people have been lost in the woods. At the time, I remembered something that seemed important. What I remembered was science class in grade school. In that class, I made a compass.</p><p>Even now, I remember how: Get a bowl. Put water in it. Set it somewhere flat. Take a piece of paper and put the paper on top of the bowl. Steal a sewing needle from your mother’s kit and a magnet from the refrigerator. Bring them to class. Stroke the needle over the magnet, each time in the same direction, and repeat this step for a minute.</p><p>After that, it’s simple. You place the needle on the paper and move a corner of the paper back and forth to get the needle to spin. Then, you wait. When the needle stops, follow its point to find your way.</p><p><span id=""more-941""></span></p><p>It was a lesson on magnetism — how Earth had it naturally — and how science allowed us to harness the phenomena that, before science, seemed like magic. Looking back, it was quite the message, though of course it was lost on the class.</p><p>The reason it was lost wasn’t that we weren’t perceptive; it was because mine didn’t work. Rather, my needle never stopped. It kept spinning, going faster and slower as I neared and retreated. The class was in awe.</p><p>A boy in the class told me about his uncle. About how I was like this uncle in that I too was a “water witch.”  Many know them as “dousers,” but in short they’re people who are believed to be able to find water using nothing but a twig and some inner connectivity with nature. How it works is they take a <i>Y</i>-shaped, light-weight branch from a tree, hold the two ends of the <i>Y</i> with both hands, and walk. When they are above water, no mater how far above, the branch will turn downward in their hands and point toward the water below.</p><p>The way that many discover their power is through magnets. Dousers have trouble finding reliable compasses, and though these compasses might not spin wildly in the hands of a water witch, they don’t point North. So, that day in class, it was settled: I was a water witch.</p><p>When I was lost in the woods, remembering this day in class was comforting. I had long given up on the hope of having some magical power, or anything at all that made me different from anyone else. No matter; the thought was reassuring: even if I had a compass, I still might be lost — and not just because I couldn’t remember whether the adjoining road ran east to west or north to south. And lost or not, I would never go thirsty, as long as I was willing to dig.</p><p>In the coming posts, I can assure you that you’ll read from those who have lost their way, and maybe found it again, and maybe did so using a compass. Maybe that compass is metaphorical. And maybe these pieces are in some way a metaphorical compass for you. Maybe you are lost and these stories will serve as your guide. Maybe you’re looking for this piece, right here, to be that guide. I want to assure you: it’s not. Rather, there are only two morals I have to share: First, if you want to impress a group of third-graders, construct a compass and leave the magnet in your jeans pocket. And second, if you need to find your way, use a compass. It will take you wherever you want to go … as long as where you’re going is north.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the theme. Or, dare I say, get lost in it.</p>","2013-5-5","[115, 596, 421, 429, 479, 409, 319, 71, 60, 87, 182]"

You weren’t a rock star, after all. No risk of getting fat and fading away.</p><p>Sometimes, especially if I granted you that second syllable, you’d persist. “What would I do with myself at that point, you know?” (You’d open up your laptop.) “It’d be so boring.” (Arrested Development would be playing, though you’d seen each episode at least three times.) “You know?”</p><p><span id=""more-1066""></span></p><p>But the real rockers — I wonder if that’s how they felt. If Elvis feared obscurity more than oblivion. If Jimi worried about wrinkles. If Johnny Cash ever murmured a death wish to June in those confused moments before sleep; if he ever proclaimed one defiantly into a mug of coffee: “I’d rather be dead than eighty.” If June would sigh in reply or look back at him with eyes sharp and glistening as moonshine, wondering whether she wasn’t enough, whether their love might be worth the arthritis and boredom. “Eat your breakfast,” she’d say, afraid that God had heard him.</p><p>You’d rather be dead than eighty, you told me — picturing, perhaps, the afternoons spent entering and exiting sleep alongside a murmuring television, the slow decomposition of the body. Picturing the day you’d need help in a public bathroom stall, your son-in-law lowering you to the seat and looking away with some mixture of politeness and pity, blocking the door to spare you the dignity. Your concern wasn’t Johnny’s, exactly. He thought people would stop paying attention. Were you afraid they’d have to start?</p><p>Or — or was it this. Johnny would lower his mug and look at June; he’d want to tell her everything but knew it’d sound stupid. He’d do it anyway: “What happens if I lose it all, June?” It was the kind of paralyzing, vague fear that might come upon him in line at the grocery store. “What if a big thing gets small?”</p><p>You’d lower your mug, too, and look at me, and you’d be a small thing, and it was that smallness, the smallness into forever you were afraid of, but you’d plaster over it with <i>so boring</i> and <i>you know</i>. What if a small thing never got bigger?</p><p>Then again, I was the only one you ever said it to — <i>I’d rather be dead than eighty — </i>and so I can’t shake the feeling that it was neither of those. That you were declaring something about yourself, picking a role, because you were afraid I’d become the June to your Johnny, the sun to your moon, and you wanted the roles reversed. To be dead and not eighty is to explode like a Kerouacian sun, to erupt with the sheer force of life and life lived. To be eighty and not dead is to watch stars explode around you, to have that slowly drain your light because you’d merely been reflecting them all along. It is to be inert, stony, alone.</p><p>(When June died, Johnny only waited four months to join her.)</p><p>But you had forgotten the thing about moonshine: that jarred, collected, it might be set ablaze. Put a lighter to it and it’d burn like a little sun.</p>","2013-8-8","[721, 596, 490, 409, 698, 20, 373, 143]"

"Those Beautiful Delhi Boys","[14, 5]","11","Reina Gattuso, ’15","{{174 aligncenter}}<p>The devotees sit crosslegged in the tomb not eating the food laid before them, plates glossy pink and turmeric yellow with papaya and daal. The tile is khichri-slippery, and I have forgotten it is Ramadan. The Dargah of Sufi saint Nizaamuddin Auliya, a labrynthine complex open to the sky, shivers with a crowd: disciplined worshippers at a feast uneaten, as though laid out for ghosts. But they are vibrantly fleshy, minding babies and gesticulating as they wait for the siren signalling iftar to tumble down. I snake into a bulging queue with a combination of elbows and sweet talk, half propelled by the crowd and half propelling, until I am spat out, salty and sweating, at the tomb of Amir Khusrau.</p><p><span id=""more-1462""></span>Now there is Grindr, and before Grindr there was Yahoo, but before Yahoo—much before Yahoo—there was the bazaar. There are different myths in circulation about who imported homosexuality into India: some say the Britishers; others, through hard porn and soft imperialism, America. But for those whose proclivities tend toward the Hindu nationalist, there is always the option of blaming Islam. Of course, the evidence that homoeroticism was present on the subcontinent far before the medieval period is abundant—but in the paranoid, anachronistic tally of sexual sin, the Persian and Urdu poetic tradition in India, largely Islamicate, deserves a special shout out. And the tradition itself has a special place in its heart and loins for love between sweet-talking men and cruel, fuzzy-lipped boys.</p><p>Amir Khusrau, twelfth century Persian and Hindavi poet, was himself a great connoisseur of bazaar culture—or at least, his poetic speaker was. A sufi himself and a devotee of Nizamuddin, Khusrau is memorialized next to his teacher. That’s why he’s here, and that’s why I’m here, too, standing in front of his tomb on a smoky Thursday evening as parched dust eddies where the lazy breeze gestures, head bowed against the poet-saint’s tomb. It’s a slow night, acrid with kabob smoke and rain-longing, and I am feeling macerated with unrequited love. The pain of the beloved in Khusrau’s brand of poetry is less the cruelty of the forbidden than that of the unreciprocated, the heartsore: aloof queer girls with hair wound long like chains, eyelashes, lethally, Maybelline sharp.</p><p><em>            Ah me, shackled to your every strand of hair. </em></p><p>But in Khusrau’s poetic universe, sharp-eyelashed women aren’t the only ones cutting through the defenses of hapless lovers; there’s also the pain of barely-bearded boys. “The flourishing towns and markets created a culture of the streets based on interaction between men,” writes Saleem Kidwai in his and Ruth Vanita’s seminal <a href=""http://books.google.co.in/books/about/Same_Sex_Love_in_India.html?id=rVlhw1u8dSwC"">anthology</a> on same-sex love in Indian literary and cultural history. “In these bazaars men from different classes, castes and communities mingled; here homoerotically inclined men met and established relations” (108). There are still cruising grounds in Delhi—humid parks lush green in the early evening—but cruising, I am told, is an affair increasingly separated by class. As in America, the sexual marketplace has moved online, and those who can take to the internet, do. The risk, however, remains stark. It’s common to hear stories of extortion or kidnapping, of police posing as potential partners then blackmailing instead. The <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/section-377-the-way-forward/article5740242.ece"">recent reinstatement</a> of Indian Penal Code 377 has only aided the threat.</p><p>Kidwai’s analysis of bazaar culture and how it surfaces in poetry has its critics, as does the entire reclamatory project of the same-sex, the homoerotic, the queer. How can one make a genealogy of definitionally unstable categories like gender—categories that don’t necessarily apply to the historical periods in question? Yet the rallying cry against “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” is that it’s un-Indian; the very weapon used against queers is twistedly historical. In this context, then, it is powerful to claim a line.</p><p>Evening topples onto the Dargah suddenly. At the siren the crowd glimmers, wakes and stirs; hands and mouths grow newly busy, and food disappears into burnt edges of roti and slick mango skins. Then everyone’s standing, shifting, fixing their kurtas, pushing for the exit, and I drift with the crowd away from Khusrau toward Nizamuddin’s tomb. When the call to prayer blows in like a fresh wind we are all buffeted by it; it sweeps the crowd. Then suddenly the Dargah is almost empty: a few swaying worshippers, a mucky open floor. The Qawwali singers, six or seven men in kurta pajama, are setting up shop.</p><p>Khusrau—notoriously virile— is considered the father of a lot of things: the tabla, the sitar, and the qawwali, the genre of devotional Sufi song. As in much Persian and Urdu poetry, in Khusrau’s work, religious devotion and secular sexiness get all mixed up. Yearning for the human lover becomes yearning for the divine, and vice versa; consummation, in both cases, is almost never reached. The longing for God is erotic, and it is a genderfuck.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;""><em>I am enslaved by that face<br/>

The vocals tear from the singers’ throat with fullness: the way relatives’ faces ballast with tears at weddings, or my mother’s expression when she says she misses me terribly and wants the summer to fly to my return. It is a benevolence bulging with longing, a turgid cell, a fish that has gorged itself to its own exploding, a body narcotic with love.</p><p>When the musicians finish, I feel as though I have been stood up: standing all hopeful in pink lipstick waiting for a girlfriend, but nobody’s come.</p><p>It was winter when I got my Khusrau copy, a dry and dusty season, headachey with studying and tiredness, sunlight weak and apartment cold.

"Showtime: Naked","[21]","7","Hana Bajramovic ’13","<p>We went to the theater last week. On a Sunday evening, cold, to see a play my mother had read about in the Tribune and later termed The Show That Had That Scene With The Naked Guy. It had other merits, of course, like an onstage pool of water and literary references, but when we stepped into the elevator with no one else around she looked down, shaking her head: “I just don’t know why he was naked.”</p><p>It was the aggressive sexuality of it all, the nude’s lack of subtlety, that made her so uncomfortable—but there was something else, maybe. He was so transparent up on the stage. There he was, all of him. His heart-shaped birthmark, usually tucked into his trousers like a piece of gum stuck between the leaves of a napkin, breathed free instead under hot lights. She felt, I think, like a voyeur.</p><p><span id=""more-446""></span></p><p>“Mom, push the button,” my sister nudged. We were still on the first floor. “Anyway,” my mother went on, “he could have worn a diaper or something. You weren’t naked in your debates, were you?”</p><p>I should probably clarify. I used to do Speech, which my mom calls Debate (my sister does Debate, which my mom calls Speech), and I never was, nor ever felt the need to be, nude. She meant merely to propose that my sixteen-year-old self, neatly wrapped in a black pantsuit, had subtlety—that first thing violated by the actor’s nudity. But did I? When, in high school, I competed in Dramatic Duet Acting, the scenes my partner and I chose were hardly understated: the climax of Edward Albee’s <i>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i> (which opened, if I recall, with “George, get me a drink”), and two years later, the climax of Ryan Craig’s <i>The Glass Room</i>, the story of a Holocaust-denying historian and her Jewish lawyer. We were clothed, to be sure, but our words weren’t shy.</p><p>My scene partner—Frank, hi Frank, if you’re reading this we should get coffee Frank—was a brilliant actor. He was well-trained, but with a natural talent that would manifest itself as a sidelong glance or a particularly apt pronunciation of the word “love.” And I was new: to acting, to the Speech Team. I thought shouting lines made them more powerful and sighing deeply signified <i>intense regret</i>. I was, by all counts, totally unsubtle.</p><p>Synonymous with <i>unsubtle</i> is <i>transparent</i>, both hallmarks of Naked Guy, but the two don’t always travel together. Loud as I was, transparent I was not. And transparency is what I’m really getting at. What good actors do—what Frank did—is suspend me in their silences, keep me affixed to what seems so real in their emotions. When Frank spoke I could have sworn that that was what he felt, that I was seeing to the core of him. Then in a second, with a muttered, “Let’s take it from the top,” it all evaporated.</p><p>This transparency—and it was that, it felt like that!—was not of the fleshy variety that so discomfited my mother. No, this was the illusion of transparency. Frank was playing sad, and when the curtain fell his smile would return. But the actor in that show was not <i>playing</i> nude, he simply was; and so the delicate artifice of the play-world, where all emotions are genuine and poignant for the span of ninety minutes, collapsed.</p><p>This is what is unsettling about the naked body in theater. It is so distinctly non-performative. It speaks to our anxieties, we who carefully construct our artifices, each for a separate audience. (She laughs, throwing her head back, because she read in Cosmo once that men find that attractive.) Non-illusory transparency is terrifying because of its accompanying vulnerability, yes, but also because it cannot mold to its audience: when the actor is naked on stage he’s the same naked every day, though the cadence or the inflections of his monologue might change. We wear different selves based on mood and weather and surroundings, and to imagine that this power might be taken from us—well, what would they <i>think</i>?</p><p>I like the discomfort of the nude actor. It reminds me how few people I know as their naked selves. But it <i>is</i> discomfort, and this may have been part of what upset my mother. Then again, we were her daughters, and there was a naked man on stage. Why cloak the truth of the thing in verbiage?</p>","2012-12-27","[733, 490, 648, 294, 700, 186, 564]"

Returning a year, month, or week, to a book you rather liked the first time around, you feel a twinge of shame that the first pages’ metaphors are so <i>freshly</i> wonderful. You blush to realize<b> </b>that the comic subplot had entirely evaporated from your memory. Rereading the seminal (you thought) novel of that discontented summer, you seriously question where your atrophied memory places you within the populace; when every page seems so resolutely new, just what from this text had affected you so? Nabokov said that “one cannot read a book, one can only reread it,” but that’s cold comfort for the prospect that your remembrance of <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> may be as detailed as, and less accurate than, its Cliffnotes.</p><p><span id=""more-1276""></span></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">Marginalia buttress this tenuous hold we have on our texts. They reassure us of our sentience as readers. Scribbling in page-frames, we become Le Philosophe lisant, meeting works with the courtliness and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/nopassio.htm"" target=""_blank"">“scruples of welcome”</a> they deserve. Returning to Ode to Autumn in one dogeared volume, an old side note testifies that Keats picked up his “clammy” cells from Dryden’s rendition of Virgilian Pastorals. A cryptic index of page numbers over “Chapter One” lines up favorite sentences from The Charterhouse of Parma. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the sovereign and name-giver of marginalia, was an annotator in high demand. How wonderful to be able to make that request!</p><p>A margin once referred exclusively to a border around a sea or a lake; then around anything at all; then around text typeset on a page. Economists wonder what welfare is accrued at the margin, what extra return might tip over a system. How much better do we converse with each successive annotation? When does the return on marginalia end?</p><p>In 1637, Fermat squeezed in a mention of one “truly marvelous proof” into the white space around his copy of Arithmetica, thus precluding the proof itself.</p><p>Notations by, and not just on, luminaries can stir a voyeuristic fervor. Books can sometimes be about others’ books: the hope persists that one bracketed comment will pull back the curtain on some truly great, synthetic way of reading that informs the writing we love. Yet, David Foster Wallace, in the front-papers to his Rabbit, Run, asserts only that <a href=""http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2010/dfw/books/"" target=""_blank"">“Rabbit Mourns Himself.”</a> What are we to make of this, of anything? In the eighteenth century, annotation was an explicitly social pastime; groups of friends would circulate a single book until its margins were entirely blackened. Annotation in its current iteration is a whispered colloquy. One must distinguish, for now, between marginalia and scholia.</p><p>We wring our hands that marginalia will be coterminous with books made of paper, but our scribal impulse is too strong. The new, jostling mediums will do for the art of marginalia what photography did for painting; our notes can tesselate and refract, on electronic books and edges of screens, into Cubist meta-texts. Having thwarted its severest constraints – the size of the margin and penmanship – marginalia will have a radical new poetics.</p><p>On the edge, we scribble off the deep end.</p>","2013-12-13","[311, 370, 674, 467, 556, 188, 376, 537, 486]"
"From the Archives: Gilinsky and Feehan","[2, 19]","11","Isaac Dayno ’15","{{21 size-full}}<p>Fractured faces smile above a whirring tessellation of legs and wheels, bodies broken and re-grafted in a latticework of steel and bone. Two lines of scrambled text scrawl beneath the image before terminating in a single, indecipherable word. The artwork is the result of two student artists – one having crafted text, the other the image it describes – and the piece thrums with division and recombination. The visual artist has taken a mild mid-twentieth century snapshot and fragmented the image, Xeroxing and re-Xeroxing rectangular portions onto a single plane, multiplying the mechanized reproductive mode of the photograph. The process of reproduction, akin to Warhol’s silk-screening, has preserved and introduced imperfections into the artwork. Some tessellated fragments are overexposed or contrastingly dark, others rough with large grains. The text repeats similar flaws in the inconsistency of ink and jumbled, offset type: the third line comprises the letters “g” and “e” and a final, crossed-out character. The relationship, however, between the text and the image is ambivalent. The process of creation and collaboration among artists is unclear and as a result parsing the dialectic between symbol and icon, reference and referent, falls to the viewer. Looking between text and image, the artwork begins to take on an erotic turn. The last word of “gex” links together a string of sexual phrases – “limbs”, “still warm from” and what could be “(k)issed” – and turns the viewer back to the content of the image. And yet on investigation <em>Untitled</em> presents not a passionate vision of two lovers on a motorbike, but a frustrated sensuality and a mechanistic neutering of the erotic. The legs of the young couple are reconfigured as gears of the automobile; natural locomotion and flesh propel only wheels. This reassignment becomes altogether menacing and the smiling faces of the motorcycle riders, many-headed and obscured by glasses and a scarf, appear less and less human. The image and its text point not only to the melding of man and machine, but moreover to the unsettling seams of such an alignment.</p><p><span id=""more-915""></span></p>{{112 size-full}}<p>The co-artists touch on a common thematic fear, similarly noticeable in the art of Dadaists of the early-twentieth century. Hannah Hoch’s iconic photomontage <em>Pretty Maiden</em> of 1920 echoes a similar anxiety about the interdependence of the machine and the bodily while also pointing to a sterile sexuality. Like Hoch’s maiden, the fecundity of the young woman in this image becomes the productiveness of the assembly line, her output limited to spokes, bolts and rubber. A light bulb replaces the head of Hoch’s woman as she drowns in BMW logos, and here the tesserae effect of Xerox and use of text also point to the synthesis of man and machine. <em>Untitled</em> echoes Hoch and succeeds in illustrating that the more forced the marriage of the two, the greater the asexuality. In its production, the visual artist has violently spliced, cloned and reassembled the original photograph to present an image of the human body as it ceases to be human. The effect is startling and nearly sickening, just as Hoch’s light bulb-headed creation hints at something at once familiarly fleshy and violently mechanical.</p><p>But is this something to be feared? Or quite possibly wished? Complicating the artwork are the words of Warhol: “I want to be a machine” (<i>Art News</i>, 1963). Though it has been argued that this image and its text elicit unease in the violent reconfiguration of the body and the mechanized, <em>Untitled</em> may also share Warhol’s ambition. This evidences a healthy degree of ambiguity in the artwork that implies further and deeper readings, especially in the combined effort of artists and the ekphrastic relationship between word and image.

Blog editor Kevin Hong ’15 describes our vision for this theme below.</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">“The boat that lands there with a cargo of ginger and cotton will set sail again, its hold filled with pistachio nuts and poppy seeds …. ”</p><p style=""text-align:right;"">Italo Calvino, <em>Invisible Cities</em></p><p style=""text-align:left;""><span id=""more-512""></span> Reading <i>Invisible Cities</i>, you reach Euphemia, a trade city in which you exchange not only sacks of grain and barrels of pig’s feet, but also stories. Upon departure, you find that your memories will have been transformed by the words that you have bartered: “Your sister will have become a another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle other battles….” In Euphemia’s busy harbor, memory is traded as well.</p><p>There are other trade cities: in Eutropia, which comprises a number of cities, its inhabitants move from place to place whenever they feel, collectively, weary of their jobs, their lovers, their houses and debts. In the next city they fill new jobs, have new hobbies, and enjoy new friends; each city is a harbor for lives that shuttle back and forth, repeating the same scenes, but with different players. Ersilia’s citizens sustain the city by weaving intricate webs of relationships in their homes; when these webs “become so numerous that you can no longer pass through them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.”</p><p>Each city that Calvino describes is a harbor—by nature temporary, elusive, and ever-changing. ‘Harbor’ is related to the French <i>auberge</i>, meaning ‘inn.’ Protected by piers, a harbor is a dispassionate guardian, indiscriminately taking in bridge players, flus, magicians, and thieves for as long as they have business in port. A poem, with its own jetties and moorings, is a harbor of sorts. So are a lover, a lung, four years of college.</p><p>The same harbor appears differently to different people. A seasick voyager sees his home; a sailor finds respite from a storm; the traitor carefully moors his thoughts. We take refuge in its embrace, just as a harbor finds a resting place in the mind. There is always a harbor, but where it is and when it will cease is always uncertain.</p><p>Look at the dock on which you stand now; it is passing from prosperity to ruin. “The piers are pummelled by the waves,” Auden wrote: as Aeneas escaped Troy, as Ersilia’s citizens desert their homes, so we move from harbor to harbor. One after another, they sink below the ocean’s surface. What comes next? What haven lies in the offing? The harbor welcomes all of this: the orchids, jealousy, the crates of avocados, and the hulking ships that come to anchor, sails furled, but slightly unsettled.</p>","2013-2-1","[468, 711, 723, 468, 409, 670, 277, 431, 60, 69]"

"A Monastic Playground","[16]","11","Liza Batkin ’15","{{159 alignnone size-full}}<p>The <a href=""http://www.armoryonpark.org/"">Park Avenue Armory</a> was built in the 1860’s to headquarter the 7<sup>th</sup> New York Militia Regiment. And the Wade-Thompson Drill Hall, as its name suggests, served as a training ground for American soldiers. When I went to see Ann Hamilton’s <i><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/arts/design/ann-hamilton-at-the-park-avenue-armory.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">Event of a Thread</a></i>, however, the space was devoid of its disciplined phantoms. Occupied by swings, pigeons, Ralph Waldo Emerson, white fabric, caped poets, caped readers, and caped bird-releasers, the drill-hall became at once amusement park and monastery.</p><p>Upon entering the space, I came across two seated persons, their fur-draped backs facing me. They were reading into microphones from manuscripts (of selected lines from Emerson’s essays) that draped off the table, folding upon themselves in wordy ribbons. I imitated a neighbor and held to my ear, like a conch-shell, one of the brown paper bags sitting on the table, to find that it contained a radio transmitting the voice of one of the caped readers.</p><p><span id=""more-475""></span></p><p>Past the readers and ribboning words began the swings, suspended from the ceiling by chains on both sides of a white curtain. Ropes attached to both the chains and the curtain ran through a pulley system, making the white swath swing. The curtain was twice as wide as the hall, so it, like Emerson’s prose, gathered and folded upon itself—its ribbons not grounded but suspended and restless, responsive to the comings and goings of the swings on either side. As Hamilton elegantly puts it, “the shifting weather of the white cloth is generated through collective action.”</p><p>While the weather of the lofty silk was socially generated, that of the swing was individually so. The path of each swing, illuminated on the floor by a strip of light, was private, to be tread by no one but the current sitters (I say this in warning, having been rear-ended by a particularly vigorous swinger). My paper bag spoke: <i>cause and effect are two sides of one fact.</i> Here, private moments culminated in a shared woven commotion. Private motion caused public stir; the two co-existed in un-contentious reciprocity.</p><p>On the end of the hall opposite the readers sat the monk-like poet, who toiled away at his verse, apart from the commotion. We were witnesses to his solipsistic moment. The poet’s privacy inspired others to seek the same; several visitors retreated into the shadows by the walls. One stared into the pages of Joyce’s <i>Dubliners</i>. Some climbed to the balcony, apparently heeding their paper bags: <i>the field cannot be seen from within the field</i>, says Emerson.</p><p>While wholly unique, “Event of a Thread” reminded me of two similarly space-transformative installations— one that created a domestic space; the other, a social space. In the show last year at Bard College’s <a href=""http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/"" target=""_blank"">Hessel Museum</a> entitled “<a href=""http://www.bard.edu/ccs/exhibitions/if-you-lived-here-youd-be-home-by-now/"" target=""_blank"">If you lived here, you’d be home by now</a>,” Josiah McElheny displayed his own artworks along with works from the private collection of Marieluise Hessel in galleries furnished as a living room, bedroom, library, and dining room. McElheny’s co-curator, Lynne Cooke, describes their project in a book she edited in conjunction with the show, <span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><a href=""http://www.bard.edu/ccs/read/publications/interiors/"" target=""_blank"">Interiors</a></span>. She explains that they sought to invite visitors to engage with the work personally, comfortably, at their leisure; to linger and incorporate the surrounding art as a backdrop to “conversations, musings, and distracted mental driftings.” Their ambition was to provoke a private, internal experience.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, the German artist <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/06/120806fa_fact_collins"" target=""_blank"">Tino Sehgal</a> specializes in performance-based, participatory installations that engage the spectator. An exhibit at the <a href=""http://www.mariangoodman.com/"" target=""_blank"">Marian Goodman Gallery</a> in 2007 called “<a href=""http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2007-11-30_tino-sehgal/"" target=""_blank"">This Situation</a>” featured several performers having a philosophical discussion. My family and I, visitors to the show, were encouraged, implicitly and sometimes directly, to join in. The significance of this piece was its social, rather than private, implications for the visitor; it traded solipsism for community (and perhaps some shyness and discomfort.)</p><p>McElheny, Sehgal, and Hamilton all share an aspiration to free art from the purview of the ascetic, numb-footed museum-goer. McElheny invites viewers to adopt his installation as the backdrop to an internal narrative; Sehgal, on the other hand, forces his viewer into a social space. In “Event of a Thread,” Hamilton encouraged the visitor both to retreat within and to engage without. While the transformed drill hall resemblesd no domestic space, the installation, like McElheny’s curation, invited an interiorized experience. The reader of Joyce and swinging couple can attest to this. And while the installation’s readers and poet remained occupied at their own tables, unresponsive to the rare visitor’s attempt to engage them, they, like Sehgal’s philosophizing performers, socialized the space. The very mechanics of the pulley-drawn curtain made physically manifest this private-public interplay. Hamilton puts it best: “If on a swing, we are alone, we are together in a field. This condition of the social is the event of a thread. Our crossings with its motions, sounds, and textures is its weaving; is a social act.”</p><p>In addition to the private-public exchange, the object of the swing contributed to another binary whose fine line “Event of a Thread” elegantly treaded: serious and playful. In transforming a seat into a vehicle of fun, and then inviting her visitors to enjoy it, Hamilton played seriously with notions of art-viewing. Diana Fuss and Joel Sanders, in “<a href=""http://www.bard.edu/ccs/read/publications/interiors/"" target=""_blank"">An Aesthetic Headache: Notes from the Museum Bench</a>,” describe the museum bench as a symbol of man’s unavoidable embodiment, that which enables him to surrender rather than attend to the artwork before him. In “Event of a Thread,” Hamilton attached the bench to chains and mobilized it into action. She embraced her visitor’s embodiment and desire to surrender, but the playful seat she provided compelled him, instead, to move and engage with her art.</p><p>Hamilton maintained her installation’s artistic integrity while allowing her visitors to seriously play within it. Fuss and Sanders describe in the same essay the public’s initial fear that a bench, when located within the museum (newly developing as a private institution), would encourage the behavior that it did in a public park: “flirting, playing…talking, laughing, and napping.” And if the park bench elicits this association, much more so does the park swing. Part of the magic of “Event of a Thread” was its capacity to permit such associations (the swings saw a fair share of all of the above-mentioned behaviors) while remaining artful and meditative. Hamilton succeeded in creating a world in which we could be both serious and playful, both alone and in good company.</p><p><em>Picture courtesy of <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/12/07/arts/design/20121207-HAMILTON-2.html"" target=""_blank"">Philip Greenberg for The New York Times</a></em></p>","2013-1-10","[516, 97, 66, 110, 518, 692, 333, 514, 598]"

Jeff. We met at Café Gato Rojo to discuss psychedelia, Harvardiana, and miscellanea. The following is a transcription of the parts of our conversation I deemed blog-appropriate. You can hear L.A. Jeff live this Saturday, October 19, 9 pm, at 21 South Street.</em> – <em>Kevin Hong ’15</em></p><p><span id=""more-1208""></span></p><p>Kevin Hong: Where are you guys from?</p><p>Nico Schwalbe: I was actually born in L.A., but I grew up in France. Parker is from here, Will is from NorCal, Sam is from England and Saman is from New York, but his family is from Iran. So we’re really from all over the place, which is somewhat unusual since bands so often form in these local microcosms.</p><p>KH: What was your previous band name?</p><p>NS: Lunar Volk, which is the name of our EP now. It was all recorded and engineered at the SOCH studio. Dan Thorn, who graduated in ’11, engineered and mixed everything except “To Good to Be True,” which was mixed by Strange Majik in NYC. I really want to give Dan and his band, The Dying Falls, a shout out for all the support they’re giving us!</p><p>KH: You played a bossa nova cover at your last show; I’m curious about how bossa nova fits into your style.</p><p>NS: Well that’s interesting. I’ve always had a connection to Brazil and Brazilian music because my family lived there for four years. My mom and my aunt, who passed away last year, were always listening to it. For me it’s always been there. In a lot of ways the format is jammy and there have been bands like Os Mutantes …</p><p>KH: The Mutants?</p><p>NS: Yeah! They were kind of one of the first psychedelic bossa nova bands in the sixties. They added the fuzz pedal to bossa nova, so there’s definitely a bridge between psych and bossa nova. Psychedelic music is supposed to “transcend” national boundaries: there’s Indian psych, psych folk, psych blues … It goes on and on.</p><p>KH: How about psychedelicious?</p><p>NS: Psychedelicious! I guess it’s psychedelicious because it’s supposed to stimulate your imagination in a pleasurable way.</p><p>KH: For the brain buds?</p><p>NS: Yeah, tasty for your brain buds.</p><p><em>(Laughter)</em></p><p>KH: Would you say Os Mutantes are one of your main influences?</p><p>NS: No, I wouldn’t say that because Saman and I are the ones who are really into that kind of music. Ultimately we all converge on sixties garage rock, which is such a huge mine of music. There were so many tiny bands back then: one guy would get a guitar for Christmas and the other guy a drum set and start a band, write these two minute songs. In terms of more recent psychedelia, I’ve been personally very influenced by the Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is essentially the vision of this one guy, Anton Newcombe, who’s been at it for  a very long time. I guess he kind of embodies the myth of the mad artist … for better or for worse. I also really like Sonic Youth. Sam really loves them, too.</p><p>KH: How would you guys characterize your band? I’m interested in the idea of a psychedelic band like yours being influenced by pretty crazy people, but also by more academic interests.</p><p>NS: I think most of us have a very nerdy, almost encyclopedic approach to music, which is reflective of the academic environment that we’re in. For myself, I’ve spent a lot time doing a lot philosophy stuff so it’s interesting to me to see the connections between theory and practice.</p><p>KH: You’ve also mentioned that you have this dream of pressing vinyl. You stream music, so why vinyl, which seems outdated?</p><p>NS: Yeah. In the world of rock music vinyl is pretty prevalent for releases because it has a more “expansive sound,” whatever that means. I didn’t really use to be into it until I kind of had a revelation where I was like: ”Wow, this really sounds better!” I think it’s a personal preference though. I guess today the real fans get the vinyl, just because it does offer a more complete listening experience; mp3 is so compressed, so you lose a certain sense of space. I don’t really think anyone makes any money selling vinyl though. <em>(Laughter)</em></p><p>KH: You mentioned that the garage punk bands of the sixties wrote very short songs, while yours seem to be longer.</p><p>NS: It’s true; our songs do tend to be more in the four-minute range. I like short, I like long, each one has its virtues. People also played short in the sixties because that’s how much music you could get on one of those cheap seven-inch 45rpm discs!</p><p>KH: I guess they had a different conception of the portable in those days …</p><p>NS: Totally. What’s really cool is a lot of music from that era, like Jamaican rocksteady and Ska, which Saman and I love, was mastered for small crappy radio speakers, so now it sounds great on your phone! Today, though, music is much bassier, which doesn’t sound great on the phone. So, in a sense, it’s less portable!</p><p>KH: That’s really interesting …</p><p>NS: I also think it’s fascinating that it’s really in the sixties that music started to become a mass consumption good, which it still is today, although a large part of that consumption is demonetized and basically free. When you’re paying Spotify, Rdio or Pandora you’re not paying the artist; you’re essentially paying for your access to unlimited free music.</p>{{33 size-full}}<p>KH: Where do you see L.A. Jeff in two or five years?</p><p>NS: Touring, hopefully, making more records, playing disco and funk (one of my personal dreams), and making people dance at our shows!</p><p>KH: <em>(Laughter)</em> Does no one dance at your shows these days?</p><p>NS: Not that much. A little bit?</p><p>KH: Is that a Harvard thing?</p><p>NS: It seems to be more of a US thing. I know that in France, where I’m from, people dance more willingly. A lot of US bands like Crocodiles or the Black Angels say that, too: audiences in Europe dance more, which is why we wanna go there!</p><p>KH: L.A. Jeff’s Euro trip! Do US listeners have more inhibitions?</p><p>NS: US listeners have a more critical outlook, both in the positive and negative sense of that word. They have greater exposure to rock music and it means something different to them than to European audiences. Because there’s less of a history of people being in bands there, people are more into the myth and the mystique of rock music, which is something I’m really fascinated by because rock is a myth in the dual sense of the word: it’s completely fake but it still has important symbolic capital.</p><p>KH: Greil Marcus delves a lot into this idea of the generational myth-making in rock.</p><p>NS: It’s weird, though, because for me rock isn’t really a generational thing. I really started listening to contemporary rock about a year ago. I guess I share more references with older people! I was always way more into The Stones than Radiohead, for example. I’ve been listening to them since I was three, and have been hooked ever since!</p><p>KH: You identify more with the sixties than with contemporary culture?</p><p>NS: Yeah, I guess … That’s part of the of the L.A. Jeff character. He’s stuck in the sixties.</p><p>KH: <em>(Laughter)</em> L.A. Jeff is a character?</p><p>NS: Yeah, totally. He’s a spirit friend that we carry along with us and he’s definitely stuck in the sixties delusion; there’s part of the sixties and of psychedelic culture which is definitely delusional.</p><p>KH: Is the revival of psychedelic rock intentionally delusional?</p><p>NS: Part of it definitely is. There’s this assertion that fantasy triumphs over reality, which is obviously delusional to an extent.</p><p>KH: I’m reminded of Nietzsche’s comment in “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life”; he talks about a culture’s need for an imaginary horizon. So does L.A. Jeff come from this need for imagination?</p><p>NS: Yeah, well, L.A. Jeff was born out of our imaginations one Friday afternoon over margaritas. We were trying to find a new band name, and someone had a tongue slip, and we were awestruck by the spirit that visited us. It just seemed to make sense and got our imaginations stimulated. We realized after the fact that L.A. Jeff may or may not be related to The Big Lebowski, another man stuck in the sixties.</p>","2013-10-17","[228, 348, 596, 572, 365, 671, 409, 431, 627, 266, 682, 384, 500, 19, 371, 342]"

You’ll have better luck with the AM stations, anyway. Spotlights in a barley field bear up at an old billboard that recommends AM 1020.1. “Sounds Right! 1020.1.” It’s an old ad so you’ll only hear static when you try, but tune two up and you’ll get Roy Acuff and His Crazy Tennesseans. You’ll remember that your father used to be a pretty good Roy Acuff until he found out there was already a Roy Acuff and had to start singing like himself instead.

Veer left! Take I-81 through Harrisonburg, Virginia.</p><p>You have friends in Harrisonburg so you’ll want stop off there — not to see them, though. They once introduced you to a Quaker steak and sandwich shop that sells day-old bread for ten cents to feed the ducks. You won’t feed the ducks personally, but you’ll enjoy supporting a business that supports feeding ducks. You’ll get an avocado and sprout club on a hoagie roll. You’ll imagine the ducks enjoying such a roll tomorrow. You’ll hope someone unlike you gives them the opportunity. You’ll miss your friends. Appalachians should be in sight. You won’t be hungry again.</p><p>Get off at Parkersburg (Route 42) and from there it’s a straight shot through the Shenandoah Valley. You’ll shoot straight through until you get to Buffalo Gap. Buffalo Gap is a two-block town, mostly dead, and as soon as you pass over the creek that runs perpendicular to it, you’ll lose cell phone reception for the next hundred miles. It’s that kind of town: right on the crust of civilization. You’ll think to stop there because there’s a homemade frozen custard shop in the gas station that sells Swiss Army knives to winos and old-time outlaws. You’ll recall coming here with your father as a boy. Back then you’d get vanilla custard because it was your favorite. He’d get vanilla because he hated orange, and there were only two flavors. You won’t stop there.</p><p>Begrudgingly, Route 42 turns into Route 39. You’ll miss the straight shooting of 42, but you’ll feel OK once you hit the broad turns of the Allegheny on 39. You’ll exceed the speed limit there, both because it’s easy and because there’s no one to catch you. You’ll only slow down once you realize just how easily your car could slip down the right-side ravine, where evergreen oaks finger the mile-long creases in the mountainsides, clawing toward you and the ridgeline like big cone pine spears, ready to impale. It’s recommended 25 miles per hour on the curves. You’ll speed up again later when you forget this.</p><p>You’ll pass through towns with similar-sounding names: White Sulfur Springs, White Springs, Warm Springs, Warm Bank Springs, Green Bank Springs, and then Minnehaha Springs. That’s the one you’re looking for, Minnehaha Springs. You’ll ask about that name — Minnehaha. It means laughing blue water. You’ll laugh when you find out.</p><p>You’ll pass the town’s schoolhouse, the town’s bait shop, the town’s church, and then the town’s second church. The townspeople will say there are only three things here: God, fishermen, and runaways. The third’s more rare, they’ll say, but sometimes at the junction of the great Indian rivers, ghosts still appear out of the wilderness.</p><p>The town’s “Firearms and More” store is its only landmark. You’ll pass and immediately turn left down a wooded road. (It’s private but everyone has permission.) You’ll drive across one creek, then its twin. The roads are doused in gravel, so you’ll want to drive slowly, with caution. You’ll soon see a lake, hardly a wild lake, but it’s big and holds lots of sky. You’ll want to park nearby. There’s a bridge. Cross that. You’ll see a small clearing ahead and a framed horse shed.</p><p>Bring your bike here — the one with the yellow handlebars. You’ll ride it in circles around the clearing with a borrowed baseball bat in hand. You’ll use the bat as a lance. You’ll smash dead branches from the dead tress, and you’ll chop the tops off the wild mushrooms. The shed will be locked. You could unlock it, but you won’t. There are only stirrups and stable helmets in there, anyway, and you don’t wear a helmet. When you get tired, you’ll pull threads from honeysuckle and bait them on fishhooks.</p><p>And you’ll pee a lot. You’ll pee on the trees. You pee next to the trees. You’ll pee on the shed. You’ll pee on the mushrooms. You’ll find a rusted Budweiser can half-buried next to the shed and pee on that too. You’ll pee on the barbed wire fence.</p><p>The barbed wire fence marks the edge of the property. There’s a meadow on the other side — a steer pasture where the grass grows with ticks. One day you’ll hop the barb-wired fence. There’ll be two redwing hawks overhead, beating their massive red-tipped wings, perfectly formed. You’ll buck on with them for a while; they too will be going south.</p>","2013-6-2","[115, 421, 409, 111, 676, 84, 280]"
"Spring 2014: A Conversation With Jacob Moscona-Skolnik","[3, 5]","11","Jacob Moscona-Skolnik \’16 and Colton Valentine \’16","{{121 aligncenter}}<p><em>In our second installment of pieces exploring </em>The Harvard Advocate<em>‘s spring issue, Jacob Moscona-Skolnik ’16 and poetry editor Colton Valentine ’16 discusses Jacob’s poem, “Ruth Thalia writes to the poet,” which you can find in this recent edition of the magazine. Read the abridged transcript below.</em></p><p><span id=""more-1419""></span></p><p>Colton Valentine: I wanted to start by asking you about the title of the poem. We have the speaker, Ruth Thalía, writing to you, the poet, but you’re the one actually writing. Is there some hidden commentary here on the poet and his subject matter or were you just channeling her voice?</p><p>Jacob Moscona Skolnik: This is actually the second poem in the series that I wrote using this voice of Ruth Thalía. She was the first contestant on a new game show in Peru called “The Value of Truth.”The way the show works is you have your person in the hot seat who is asked questions that get increasingly personal. As you answer the questions truthfully, you get more and more money. The objective is to keep answering questions with honest answers to accumulate money. So she’s the first contestant on this show—her family’s sitting right beside her—and she ends up admitting all these things: She has engaged in sexual activity for money; she doesn’t work where she told her parents she was working; she’s not actually in love with her boyfriend who’s sitting right there; she’s waiting for someone better. Long story short, the boyfriend, who’s humiliated on national television, ends up killing her.</p><p>One idea here was to have her writing to me—I’m a complete observer in this situation—to see what would happen if I use her voice and the way I understand all the dynamics at play in her voice. To see what happens when I address myself using that. Because obviously I’m not Peruvian; I’m not Hispanic. I’m adding all my own baggage from my life that’s unrelated to what’s going on. I wanted to make that explicit. I didn’t want to say that I’m going to come here into Peru and pretend to understand what’s going on. I wanted to make that distance really obvious and play with it.</p><p>C: So was this an attempt to get closer to her mind and her voice?</p><p>J: Potentially. It was also to try to figure out the relationship between her voice and my own even though in the poem the two obviously become mixed because I am writing it.</p><p>C: When did you first hear of Ruth Thalía?</p><p>J: I was watching this live. I was in Peru working when the show was starting, and it was huge. Everyone was so excited about this happening, and I was watching this thing with a friend in her house. After the show, there was a first round of publicity about the fact that she had admitted all these things, and then there was a second round of publicity about the fact that she was killed. Everywhere that you walked, you would see the equivalent of gossip magazines with her face on the front. It was bizarre.</p><p>C: One of our board members actually spent part of her last summer in Lima, and she talked about how the poem really captured the sense of the city. What were you doing there?</p><p>J: I was doing a couple things. I was working at a school that was set up near the heart of Lima to provide education for children with a very diverse array of disabilities. There were kids who were blind; there kids who were deaf; there were kids on crutches; there were kids with mental disabilities. A complete range. They were trying to divide them up into classrooms, but really what does that mean? I was doing that, and I was also working for Techo, which is an organization that arranges service projects in areas with high levels or urban poverty. I was frequently traveling out to these “Pueblos Jóvenes,” which are almost shanty towns on the outskirts of Lima. Very poor, urban communities. Part of the imagery comes from those areas, especially the second-to-last stanza, where you have these living structures that go right up to the edge of a highway. They continue back up onto these hills; these almost temporary-living structures just pile on top of each other.</p><p>C: This was last summer?</p><p>J: This was the summer before my freshman year, so two summers ago.</p><p>C: You said you’re not Peruvian, so what attracts you to Lima?</p><p>J: I’ve traveled a lot in South and Central American. The specific attraction to Peru is that my mom had lived there in the early eighties. She was doing medical work there, so I was living with a doctor and his wife that she had worked with thirty-plus years ago. Basically, I went with no particular agenda and ended up getting involved in these various projects and traveling around a little bit.</p><p>C: I love how this poem blends politics and aesthetics. You mention several different radical leftist groups—the FARC, sendero—and then capitalism. But it’s this white sphere. The work is always flitting with taking a political stance, but there’s all this irony and play: Capitalism is a jeopardy answer. What’s going on with all of that?</p><p>J: It’s difficult because when I write poetry my natural instinct is to tackle these big issues, these big problems. And it’s really easy when doing that, when talking about capitalism, to write things that become obvious, that have been written before, that come to not particularly meaningful conclusions, that are trite. What has helped me is taking these big ideas and not pretending that I’m coming to some dramatic conclusion in discussing them. Not saying: Capitalism is wrong, and it’s causing this problem—it has manipulated this woman through this game show and resulted in her death. To 1) not pretend I’m doing something huge with these things and 2) to make them really concrete. Which is kind of what I’m doing with capitalism—saying that it’s a sphere makes it easier to talk about. Once it’s something concrete, you can talk about that concrete thing. How does it feel? What does it look like? What’s going on? And allow that to give character to something like capitalism without explaining capitalism itself.</p><p>C: You mentioned wanting to shy away from a sort of conclusion or resolution on capitalism. The end, to me, seems to gesture toward some kind of resolution, but it is also is playing with perspective. Things were seen sideways in the past but now from above and below. Do you want it to strike as more dissonant or resolved?</p><p>J: I’m not really sure. I don’t think it really can be resolved in a satisfying way, in the same way that when someone dies in the way that Ruth Thalía dies—as a result of this game show—you can try to explain it. You can try to make sense of what’s going on. But you’re never going to really feel that you’ve come to a satisfying conclusion. I think it can go either way, but I definitely would not want someone to come away from this poem feeling like they found an answer or that it has come to a conclusion.</p><p>C: The sort of obvious addressee in this poem, from the title, is the poet. But I also felt like at certain times the “you”bordered on being the man who had killed her. Is that something that you were thinking about?</p><p>J: Interesting. I wasn’t thinking about that. The first poem in this series was her addressing the boyfriend, the guy who killed her. Potentially my writing that first poem had a trickle effect into this one.</p><p>C: How many poems are in the series?</p><p>J: So far, three, of which this is the second.</p><p>C: Is this something that you’re going to keep working on? Or do you feel like it’s a triplicate and that’s it?</p><p>J: I didn’t initially intend for it to be a series. I wrote the first one, and then Joshua Bell—I wrote this in his poetry class—suggested that I work with it. I wrote the second one because I found a new perspective that I thought would work. I don’t want to say that I will or I won’t. If I think of something that could benefit from using this voice, then I will.</p><p>C: Series are such an interesting idea in poetry because each poem has to stand on its own—and this one is being published by itself—but then they’re also working toward something larger. How do you see this as fitting into the larger project? Do you think it needs to do that? Or do they just treat a similar subject?</p><p>J: I think it can definitely stand alone. The images that are in this poem don’t need to follow from anything else. The poems are sort of additive; they just paint a more complete picture, but they can exist by themselves.</p><p>C: This poem has a very unusual form and physical appearance on the page. Some lines are indented; some groups of words are separated by extra spaces within a single line. Is there an intention behind that or did you just like how it looked?</p><p>J: I wanted to remove any formal structure: periods, commas, obvious line breaks, things like that. In part because the speaker isn’t really a person; she’s this dead voice that’s speaking from somewhere that’s not obvious or explained. Then I thought, how can I direct the way I want this to be read—the speed, the flow of the lines—in a way that someone would know what to do and how to read it without any punctuation. I came to this form in which the idea was to use space that would force a reader to subconsciously read it at a certain speed. Taking time at certain places. Putting emphasis on certain words. I just started writing it that way, and it really became easy to think of not lines or sentences in the traditional sense, but words and spaces as a way of directing the flow of the poem. It definitely doesn’t mimic him, but part of the inspiration for that came from Mayakovsky, who was a Russian poet before and after the Russian Revolution. What he did is—it’s hard to explain without seeing it graphically—but he used small line breaks and spaces to allow the display of the poem on the page to mimic speech patterns. Using actual spacing of words and lines to influence the way that the speed and flow works.</p><p>C: Right, instead of syntax, which is what you would normally use. Do you have any other main inspirations—not necessarily for this poem—but in general?</p><p>J: I have read a lot of early and mid-twentieth century Russian writers in translation. Another main influence is Lorca, who I’ve read in Spanish. Everybody loves Lorca so it feels weird to say Lorca, but he’s an inspiration for how I understand images to be most successful in poetry.</p><p>C: I thought about Lorca when I was reading this. Do you have a favorite poem by him?</p><p>J: Canción de Jinete is great. Romance Sonámbulo is another great one; it was also turned into a song. La Muerte is a lesser known one, but it’s kind of bizarre.</p><p>C: Is there anything else you want to say about this poem or yourself as the poet or Ruth Thalía? Or capitalism?</p><p>J: I guess this poem was in part my attempt to tackle these really big questions that I think everybody thinks about. But to try to do it in a way where you’re not coming to a big conclusion and you’re not pretending to do something that you’re not. But you just put these things out there, add imagery to it, and see what happens. See the emotions that can be evoked.</p>","2014-5-27","[348, 450, 569, 161, 571, 157, 273]"

"Introduction: Hat Trick","[5]","11","","{{186}}<p><em>Members of the Harvard Advocate riff on the first theme of the year, Hat Trick</em>.<em> Business member Calvin Willett ’16 gives us an introduction.</em></p><p>As with most slang, the origin story of the phrase “hat trick” is mostly apocryphal.  Most sources though, including the OED and user SeniorMoments of <a href=""http://www.funtrivia.com"" target=""_blank"">www.funtrivia.com</a>, seem to indicate it originates from English cricket in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.  Supposedly, on a green day, a bowler knocked down three consecutive wickets – a feat, I am told – and the crowd took up a collection, using the proceeds to buy him a hat.</p><p>This is a charming tale, and I imagine all of the chimney-sweeps involved were quite pleased. But at <i>Notes from 21 South Street,</i> we’ve chosen “Hat Trick” for more than a cricket-themed set of pieces. For two fortnights, our aim is gasps, sparks, confusion, applause, and the return of the world to its Natural Order.</p><p><span id=""more-1191""></span></p><p style=""text-align:center;""> *</p><p>Today other hat tricks might be seen on television: a European footballer cuts towards the goal, the ball wafts lazily from his instep, then hangs in the net behind a castrated keeper.</p><p>But the real moment of the hat trick is the pause while the truth washes over the crowd, dependent on all the speeds of light, sound, and neurons involved.  It’s when we look again to see that it-is-what-we-think-it-is-even-though-it-couldn’t-be.  The real watchers watch the reactions of the faces in the crowd.</p><p>A soccer player head-fakes as a magician misdirects, so that the keeper’s eyes are where he wants them.  Because if everyone is watching all the time, we can never have those moments of surprise, and tricks are never played. But sometimes you look away for a second and something happens — then you have to buy a round-trip ticket to the town where you had gym class.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">*</p><p>A philosopher might say that magic only exists in the mind of the perceiver –in the gap between expectations and reality. I would agree.  But I would add that it shares this gap with most emotions.  Jealousy, awe, sorrow, and disappointment happen when we expect one thing and get another. So a prestidigitation isn’t so different from: a surprise party, being stood up on a date, receiving sit-down-news from a doctor, a call from someone estranged, a kiss on the bench where you sit with your friends. The only thing is that sometimes the magician is: a. unwitting, b. an angel, c. no one at all.  <i>We</i> get to make magic.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">*</p><p>Another trick: a witch in Salem, cast into the water.  The town waits for her hat to rise.  Why are they afraid?</p><p>Once I saw a man place a baseball cap, inverted, on a table.  He would flip sideways over the table, with his head gracing its surface just enough to transfer the cap to his head, landing square besides.  There was clapping.  But there also was the split-second between the trick and the applause. It takes little to make us feel like a schoolboy, a cuckold, a Mary Magdalene, staring at the place where we thought something would be, but isn’t.</p><p>With tricks, the faces change only at the end. Pleasure from a trick comes, then, not from the confusion, but from its absolution.  And we are born again in a revelrous baptism at the sound of the gap being filled, the water rushing into the vacuum, returning the world to us and our state of presumed omniscience.</p>","2013-10-6","[450, 596, 278, 399, 409, 554, 32, 534]"
"Spring 2014: A Conversation with Michael Thorbjørn Feehly","[5]","11","","{{121 aligncenter}}<p>Michael Thorbjørn Feehly: There’s definitely a specific experience for this poem. I spent the summer living on the Harvard Business School campus. There are lots of rabbits over there and, if you pay attention to the animals, you’ll see there are squirrels and rabbits and that they don’t occupy the same space. I would come home at night having just seen five, six rabbits every day. And they’re just so cute. So it was this experience of seeing them, getting to have this different geography of Harvard—of where particular animals live and don’t live.</p><p>CV: I hadn’t even thought about Harvard, though that may tie into my next question, which on the “ferrovitreous cistern collecting/ dimensionless shadows of European attitudes.” The poem is so focused on the natural, mystic world, and then there’s this striking image of human presence.</p><p>MTF: I think what comes to mind visually is Widener Library, particularly on the second and third levels where you can see this brilliant light coming through thee windows in the interior courtyard, which formerly were exterior courtyards. I was trying to write based on observations I made daily while walking around in Cambridge and I think that’s why there is this particular man-made object in contrast to the natural objects. And the word “ferrovitreous”— I approached this poem with an exercise from Jorie Graham. Take any book and go through it page-by-page, writing down a list of interesting words. The wordlist for this poem came from <em>The Railway Journey </em>by Wolfgang Schivelbusch. It’s an historical consideration of how the railroads in Europe altered perceptions of time and space. Ferrovitreous was a word that popped up and it made me think of Widener.</p><p>CV: Did you choose that book specifically as a pair for this poem?</p><p>MTF: No, it was pretty random. I regularly check books out of the library, borrowing 50 to 60 books total at any given time. I picked up this book and another by Schivelbusch<strong>.</strong> I decided I wouldn’t have time to read them fully—just time enough to pick them up and skim. In the future, I might go back to that particular list of words and write another poem from it. The seeds of this poem were particular words that came from this particular book, but I chose it because I had to return it to the library.</p><p>CV: An element of this poem that generated a lot of discussion on the board was the really exuberant language. It’s almost bombastic. What made you decide to write in that register; was it was because those were the words you were coming across?</p><p>MTF: I think, partially, it was because these particular words were chosen as the seed material for the poem. They seemed to fit together in my mind. I think also there was something about the rabbit and the ear that made me conscious of sound and to prefer the longer lines and longer words. More exuberant, multisyllabic types of words. But my writing is still pretty fluid poem to poem. At the time, I’d been reading some of A.R. Ammons and had read Denis Johnson—both are completely different from this. Very sparse. If anything it’s likely a reaction to what I had been reading recently, what I had wanted to be different from.</p><p>CV: Speaking of language, language—both of the rabbit and the human—is both entrapping and liberating in this poem. That was something that I was trying to work through. Could you talk about that?</p><p>MTF: I think anybody who becomes interested in language comes across the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which I think has been shown to be incorrect by Chomsky and his universal grammar. But the idea is that the language you speak constrains what you can say and therefore constrains what you can conceive of. For example, a language lacking tenses found in other languages, might lend a speaker a different perception of time. And again it becomes absurd to say people can’t conceive of the future because there’s really no functional future tense. It’s always interested me, the idea that what you know how to say in some way constrains what you can say. Poetry sets these constraints on what you’re going to write. Yet, you continue trying to make it interesting, to make it new. I think there’s a natural tendency, then, for poems to address this issue. And there’s isolation in the poem, which ties into that—the fact that language is essentially what enables us to have community, connection, understanding, empathy. But the lack of it, the misuse of it, or the inability to use it can leave you on the outside. That relates to the interaction between a human being and a rabbit because we have no way to communicate with each other. I have no way of knowing what they think of when they hear human speech or hear human footsteps. Just as, I’m sure, they might have squeaks in registers of sound that we can’t even hear. That’s been found with elephants: that they can talk to each other over miles in very low frequency tones that without recording equipment and manipulation just are inaudible to us.</p><p>CV: Right, I got a strong sense of social anxiety, or anxiety about interacting with the rabbit and, once you’re the rabbit, with other rabbits in this poem, which is really interesting considering how confident the tone is in being able to communicate to this audience.</p><p>MTF: I think that’s definitely true: that social anxiety can obscure inward confidence just as outward confidence can obscure an inward anxiety. That’s something that I’ve come to terms with in different ways. On campus, there’s been a lot of talk about mental health and suicide; in an earlier form, the poem did reference that more strongly. Having experienced anxiety, social anxiety and generalized anxiety, I felt it was important to bring such experience into the poem.</p><p>CV: Another question about imagery that I have is on scale, which is out of control in this poem, and I mean that in the best way. In the same two lines we have the Andromeda galaxy and the amount of snow being kicked up by a rabbit. We have a warren and the entire universe. Was your mind flying between images and galaxies while writing this? What made you play with the scale so much?</p><p>MTF: Playing with scale definitely begins with becoming the rabbit, because there’s this transition from the human scale to the rabbit scale. It continues up to this image of snow being kicked up into the air and resembling a galaxy of stars. Each flake being a star or a series of stars close together. I forget where Andromeda came from, but one of my classes this semester is in astronomy. We’ve talked a lot about galaxies and stars. The mythological root behind Andromeda, a princess to be sacrificed, but who also waits to be saved—that’s also where it comes from. The fact that a star would be frightened is a strange thought to have.</p><p>CV: I also wanted to ask you about the ending: “I accelerate out of lens focus/ beyond the pointillistic boundary.” There’s some movement beyond this minute scale, beyond the ability to even perceive things. What’s going on there?</p><p>MTF: The ending now is very different from the original ending. The original ending was much more slapstick. It was essentially being hit on the head by a tree branch while chasing the rabbit. I figured the movement the poem needed was expansion outward into someplace different. Part of my thinking was about the scale, about how small an atom is, how small its parts are. I think it can be read two ways almost: becoming so large that the lens—eyesight or vision—goes out of focus as things become so large they’re just dot-like. And also to become small, to go into the infinitesimal space. I had recently finished watching a documentary about film history, and a particular reference comes from Ingmar Bergman’s <em>Persona</em>, the scene when the filmstrip literally starts to melt. A psychedelic mental breakdown portrayed on screen. That’s part of what inspired those particular lines. The reader identifies with the speaker, has to pick up all of the momentum, and really just vanish.</p>","2014-4-27","[450]"
"Review: Terrence Malick’s To the Wonder","[16]","11","Rumur Dowling ’14","<p>Since the WWII film <i>The Thin Red Line</i> (1998), all of Terrence Malick’s movies have opened with voice-overs that play on some form of the mythic invocation. The war film and <i>The New World</i> (2005) begin with appeals to a higher power, the former interrogating the mysterious relationship between being and (human) nature. <i>The Tree of Life</i> (2011) begins, after a quotation from the Book of Job, with Jack addressing the family members he will remember and reconstitute throughout the rest of the movie. The first lines of <i>The New World</i> follow the exhortative model of the classical invocation most explicitly: “Come, Spirit,” Pocahontas says. “Help us sing the story of our land. You are our mother, we your field of corn. We rise from out of the soul of you.”</p><p>In each of these cases, the voice-over, though spoken by a character anchored in the present of the narrative proper, calls forth a power or presence from beyond the temporal or spatial bounds of the plot. Rather than affecting the substantive action of the story, they accompany its unfolding and overhang its representations. In other words, they act much in the way that a prophecy is structured: they project a mode of thinking into the future events of the film by taking recourse to a higher (divine) authority, but, through their infinite re-interpretability, they can also be applied to a variety of events in mutually conflicting ways. When Private Train asks, at the beginning of <i>The Thin Red Line</i>, “What’s this war in the heart of nature?” his words clearly perforate more than just his experience in Guadalcanal or the soldiers’ encounter with the South Pacific flora and fauna. What these opening lines have in common, then, is that they all open an arena of interpretation overseen by a higher presence that is marked by two things: its absence, and, via its absence, a latent promise of events to come that will complicate or elucidate the reasons for its initial invocation.</p><p><span id=""more-900""></span></p><p>The first chapter of Malick’s newest film, <i>To the Wonder</i>, traces a fairly simple love story: Marina (Olga Kurylenko) is apparently an expatriate and struggling single mother in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) is apparently some sort of environmental rights worker from the United States, and, after they fall in love in France, she and her young daughter Tatiana return with him to Oklahoma (all of these details, though, even the characters’ names, are largely ambiguous, unstated or unexplored). The movie’s opening sequence both follows and breaks from the kind of invocatory beginning prevalent in Malick’s latest work. Marina speaks the opening lines over sequences of the couple, clearly romantically involved at this point, riding the TGV. Her voice-over comes from a point elsewhere than the moving train where the love story begins on screen, as she addresses Neil: “Newborn. I open my eyes. I melt. Into the eternal night. A spark. You got me out of the darkness. You gathered me up from earth. You’ve brought me back.” This opening invocation would appear to align with the beginning of <i>The Tree of Life</i>, in which Jack speaks,<i> “</i>Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to your door,” because Jack addresses another character who will appear in the film. But Jack appeals to his clouded memories of his deceased family members, not to loved ones we will observe him meeting as an adult, as Marina does. The connection between the biblical quotation and the opening line also summons a theological relationship and calls attention to actions still-to-come that will thicken this relationship with an interpretive grounding.</p>{{175 }}<p>Marina’s higher power-to-come exists firmly in the narrative, and the impulse behind her opening words does not lend itself to interpretations that stray too far from the substance of her speech. In her rhetorical form, she is impetuous, eliding verbs and conjunctions and using nouns as clumsy emblems of her salvation. Malick represents Marina’s hysterical dependence in her first line, and the balance of power in the relationship fully reveals itself when, after Marina and her daughter find Oklahoma disillusioning, Neil refuses to marry her when her visa expires and she returns to Europe. After this point, Tatiana largely disappears: for some reason, she is put under the custody of her father and seems to fall out of touch with her mother. This mother-daughter relationship seemed to be the film’s most promising one, as Tatiana had a sense early on that Oklahoma was not the answer for her family (“Something’s missing,” she whispers to her mother), but, like many promising details, it dissipates in the transition into the film’s next chapter. Marina, though, largely ignores her daughter’s advice, holding out hope that Neil would finally decide to marry her and thereby allow her to stay in the US. After Marina returns to Europe, Neil kindles a relationship with Anna (Rachel McAdams), a rancher who lost her first child, and subsequently her marriage, sometime in the past.</p><p>Neil, in one enigmatic sequence of him pondering his relationships, spins a crystal ball on a window sill and watches it revolve. It traces two spheres – the revolutions of the ball itself as it spins on its axis, and the oval path it traces on the sill in its movement. For all its allegorical significance, it is an apt image for the way relationships work in <i>To the Wonder</i>, because, incredibly, Marina and Anna both spend large portions of their time with Neil by whirling in circles a few paces ahead of him. We are told Marina is a former ballet dancer, as if that explains anything. Clearly, though, it does not – Anna, the experienced rancher, is just as susceptible to these twirling swoons. After her first child died, she says, her father told her to “Read Romans. All things work together for good.” She dismissed the advice, but somehow her relationship with Neil seems to validate the Scripture, to retroactively beatify all else she had experienced before. Anna, too, could have spoken the film’s opening lines. Her expressions of helpless devotion to Neil’s moods and indecision express the same sentiment.  The possibility of Salvation, to be “brought back,” is clearly foregrounded in the film, especially by Marina’s opening lines. It is a heady theme that promises, from its early establishment, that the rest of the film will thicken the characters of two women pigeonholed into a kind of permanent manic-dependent state. But Anna, too, is rebuffed by Neil with little explanation (in fact, he hardly speaks at all in the entire film). The women whirl and entreat, plead and desire, chatter and scream. Malick does not make much space for them to do anything else.</p>{{89 width: 610px}}<p>Neil’s failing relationships are interspersed with scenes of Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), a Catholic priest, reciting sermons or walking through the poor neighborhoods and prisons of Oklahoma. He is clearly undergoing a religious crisis of theodicy, preaching to mostly empty pews about the necessity of loving God and making decisions in accordance with His will. He spends a great deal of his screen time peering into dilapidated houses but neglecting to knock on their doors, as if too ashamed or afraid to repeat these messages to the various disabled, poor and imprisoned figures who comprise, in montage, the problematic backdrop to the love story. One woman grabs his bible and tosses it into the grass, and, in the next sequence, he hides in his house as she calls for him to come to the door. The parallels between religious and spousal duty do not extend very far. Quintana and Neil are deeply unsettled by whom they serve and what values they prioritize, but the equation is troubling. Whether the ills of Oklahoma’s rural ghettos are meant to run alongside those of a luckless love, or the weak condolences of the Church are meant to be as pernicious as the indecisiveness of a man two women fall for, the representation of these links pit the beautiful cinematic representations of the romance against the darker images of the downtrodden. Malick’s cinematography, in other words, cannot help but push the images of societal rejects to the periphery of the romantic plot. These images’ relative narrowness – close shots of pained faces, lines of dingy homes, prisoners peering through bars – cannot accumulate enough energy to dislodge the romance, gorgeously filmed amidst the tides in Normandy, the streets of Paris, and the billowing fields of Oklahoma, from the film’s center.</p><p><i>To the Wonder</i> is marked by several stylistic moves Malick is famous for: the camera panning up to capture shafts of light broken by overhanging branches, the involuntary memory represented by jump cuts from a sense-perception to a remembered event (in <i>The Thin Red Line</i>, for example, Private Bell is transported back to sequences of moments with his wife when he feels the blades of grass rub against his body as he crawls toward an enemy bunker), and the edifice rendered uncanny for its isolation in a otherwise natural landscape. These series, like a reversal of the romantic fallacy that projects human emotions onto an a-human nature, soar above and leave behind the film’s sparse narrative and thematic content. The film’s aesthetic moments ultimately expose the weakness of their own foundation, like flying buttresses and leaping spires constructed on a corroded base. Malick’s movies so often achieve because they open, frequently at the outset, certain inquiries and problems that accompany the film’s subsequent images like preludes or overtures. In this sense, then, <i>To the Wonder</i> was doomed from its start.</p>","2013-4-20","[516, 58, 709, 409, 281, 240, 675, 222, 34]"

What once primed character begins to chip away at it, sanding down a person’s agency until nothing remains but her repetitive doing. Even benign habits take their toll. If habit forms the bedrock of personality, then post this anonymously; for if I am what I repeatedly do, then I am knuckle-cracking and e-mail-reading, and of neither am I proud.

Status updates and Twitter feeds keep us checking, fomenting our embrace of the redundant while creating the illusion of perpetual novelty.</p><p>From nighttime stories and the rocking motion of the crib to the familiar rhythm of classes and weekends, our lives are inscribed with habit. We relish in the comfort of anticipated return. Sometimes this comfort becomes immobilizing. In <em>Swann’s Way</em>, Proust remarks: “Most of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services.” Habits are the personal secretaries of every man; efficient and underpaid, they enable their bosses to lounge about with minimal exertion. While Aristotle’s Habit is a noble chariot that might carry man to excellence, Proust’s is a numbing see-saw that steadies him in a predictable range of motion.</p><p>Yet the steadying force of habits, while numbing, ought not be too reviled. Rid of our demons of repetition, we would be racked with indecision. Imagine the paralysis we would feel upon waking up, getting dressed, making breakfast, if everything required reasoned deliberation. It is in part for this that the philosopher William James opined that, for every man entrapped in his habits, “it is best he should not escape.” Of course James’ recommendation is also informed by his more damning regard of a habit’s permanence: “the man can by-and-by no more escape [from his habits] than his coat-sleeve can suddenly fall into a new set of folds.”</p><p>“Habit” came into use in the 13<sup>th</sup> century to refer to the attire whose regular wear signals one’s membership in a religious order—a use we still employ. Only a century later did it acquire the additional, now primary, meaning we think of today. The word comes from the Latin “habitus,” the past participle of “habere,” which means “to have, hold, possess.” Its etymology leaves ambiguous the beholder of agency: who is the possessor here? Do we have habits, or do habits have us?</p>","2013-3-12","[133, 596, 239, 608, 74, 133, 409, 518, 256, 584, 305]"

I hope you enjoy “The Washing Room II” and the following interview.</i></p><p><span id=""more-1247""></span></p><p>Harvard Advocate: Why did you choose to write in vignettes?</p><p>My Ngoc To: I think it’s because it was the structure that best portrayed my story. Because there wasn’t one large story that could describe what I was going through, I wanted each story to focus on a different part of my life. And not even my life, but other people’s lives. I feel like <i>The Washing Room</i> is not something that happens once, or that you can follow with a line. It happens everywhere with everyone. Everyone gets dirty, everyone gets hurt.</p><p>HA: Do you think about the previous features you’ve written when you start a new one?</p><p>MNT: Actually, this book was kind of inspired by my time writing for <i>The Advocate</i>. “The Washing Room” was the first feature I ever wrote for <i>The Advocate</i>, and it was my first solid piece of writing. How this book came to be is that after I took my gap year, I came home and I felt like I had a story that had a happy ending and needed to be shared with people. I actually wrote a book that was in chronological order, that had a much more, you know, “typical” storyline. But it just didn’t feel right. I hated it, so I dropped it. During spring break I came back to it and took only the best chapters and then I combined it with all this other stuff that I wrote for <i>The Advocate</i>; I juxtaposed them in a way that made sense. And then I realized that this was the book that I was looking for.</p><p>HA: Do you think that <i>The Advocate</i> played this role in your book just by chance, or that there was something else at work?</p><p>MNT: I’m not sure if it was by chance. I comped the Features Board my freshman fall and got in; I actually wrote “The Washing Room” during my comp and it was something I was really proud of. For the first time in my life I felt that I was writing something solid and substantial. It was really exciting because somehow, I think, I entered a new stage of growth and development in my writing. And it probably came from being around so many other people who read and write well. I think I got inspiration from it without realizing it.</p><p>HA: Is your book in conversation with other authors who write about the immigrant experience?</p><p>MNT: I actually haven’t read too much immigrant literature. The only thing I can really remember is like Amy Tan, or something like <i>The Kite Runner.</i> But a lot of people who have read it told me they could really relate to my stories, because they too were immigrants, or their parents were immigrants. Or if they’re not immigrants they have been in situations when they felt alienated.</p><p>The book is called <i>The Washing Room: A Story of Stories. </i>“A Story of Stories” is the first essay I ever wrote on my family, my parents’ background. That was in the tenth grade, when I had an amazing English teacher; I guess she saw something in me and really encouraged me to write more.</p><p>HA: Are there any memoirists that have influenced your writing?</p><p>MNT: I’m less influenced by memoir writers than by poetry … After I read <i>The Tao</i> I became really fascinated by this really impressionistic way of portraying things. <em>The Tao</em> is basically a bunch of poems and vignettes and together they make something a lot bigger because they’re not confined by a strict architecture.</p><p><span style=""font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;"">The quotes I put in the book are basically by writers who have influenced me the most. Rumi, Rilke — I also like Toni Morrison a lot and Augusten Burroughs, who wrote </span><i style=""font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;"">Running with Scissors</i><span style=""font-size:14px;line-height:1.5;"">. I liked how completely honest he was and how he wasn’t afraid to show himself in very bad states. It also encouraged me to be a bit humorous in my writing. I wouldn’t call it a work of humor, but some places were funny, I think.</span></p><p>HA: What is it to write a memoir at such a young age?</p><p>MNT: Yeah, it is weird. When I tell people that I’m writing a memoir, they’re like, “You’re too young to write a memoir.” That’s why I kind of don’t want to call this a memoir, because it’s not about my “life.” I haven’t been through the typical things people in their sixties write about. I’m not famous, I’m not <i>blah</i>. The reason I wanted to write this in the first place is that I felt I had a story. The fact that it’s based on my experiences is why it has to be categorized as a memoir. But I’m really just trying to paint a picture. It’s more like “a story from a real person.”</p><p>HA: “The Washing Room II” is preceded by a Morrison quotation. Can you read it?</p><p>MNT: It’s from <i>The Bluest Eye</i>. The quote is very dreamy; it describes how I felt after I walked out of the Advocate building; at a point of recovery from something that still lingers.</p><p><i>Sunk in the grass of an empty lot on a spring Saturday, I split the stems of milkweed and thought about ants and peach pits and death, and where the world went when I closed my eyes.</i></p><p>HA: Where can one purchase your book?</p><p>MNT: <em>(Laughter) </em>If you’re friends with me, you can email me and ask. You can also get it from the Harvard Book Store and order it online. Kindle versions will be available … at some point. <em>(Laughter)</em> By the end of November.</p>","2013-11-17","[401, 228, 348, 450, 596, 310, 409, 431, 60, 531, 7, 127, 64]"

The Symposium is collection of writing on the same topic. Our aim is to explore each topic using different approaches and from different perspectives, and to delight in the coincidences and contradictions that result. This month, Rumur Dowling, Victoria Baena, Kevin Hong, and Liza Batkin discuss “Boredom.”</em></p>{{94 }}<p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>ONE</strong></p><p>“Fever is the only madness that most of us will ever experience,” Patrick Lauppe writes in his <a href=""http://theadvocateblog.net/2012/11/15/this-months-theme-fever/"" target=""_blank"">introduction to the first theme of <i>Notes from 21 South Street</i></a>. “We pursue it in hallucination and intoxication, but fever must arrive uninvited: a devil that can cross any threshold he’d like. Fever is a nightmarish house party that leaves the body ravaged and scarred from the inside out.” Perhaps he is right. But our true demon is not so gregarious. It arrives quietly, and it takes root. It is heralded not by the furious tremors of a coming surge, but by the ominous toll of a sluggish hour. The tick of a clock. The heavy sigh. The restless fluttering of an impatient foot.</p><p>In his autobiography, Roland Barthes recalls “A panic boredom, to the point of distress: like the kind I feel in panel discussions, lectures, parties among strangers, group amusements: wherever boredom can be seen. Might boredom be my form of hysteria?” His pairing of boredom with madness is not new. The thought crosses millennia of literary musing, philosophical inquiry and spiritual belief. Boredom, whether conceived as a critical attunement, psychological state, existential <i>malaise</i>, physical impairment, scholarly illness or personal weakness, was once thought to afflict those beset by a demonic envoy called acedia. Evagrius the Solitary, the fourth century Christian Desert Father, first described the fiend. Evagrius lived amidst his fellow monks in the Desert of Cells, the desolate sprawl of arid land south of Alexandria, and he envisioned a demon that latched itself to pious minds at the very moment the sun had reached its apex, when the hottest hour seemed to drag for an eternity, when the temptations of modern life in Alexandria sang out most plaintively. Distracted and disgusted with their repetitive work — the copying of scripture, the weaving of reed baskets — the monks lapsed and gave into their demons. Their boredom was a failure before God.</p><p><span id=""more-827""></span></p><p>Acedia, the worst of Evagrius’ Eight Evil Thoughts, was the most perfidious of all sins. When John Cassian, one of Evagrius’ students in North Africa, brought the principles of desert monasticism to fifth century Marseilles, the demon followed. “This is akin to dejection,” he writes, lamenting the sometimes agitated, sometimes listless condition of his disquieted monks, “especially disturbing to a monk about the sixth hour, like some fever which seizes him at stated times, bringing the burning heart of its attacks on the sick man at usual and regular hours.” A regular fever, acedia: a virus bound to its human vessel by the very monotony of his repeated tasks, a possession without the sweet delirium of a reverie, without the excitement of a skirmish of the soul.</p><p>“It renders him slothful and immobile in the face of all the work to be done,” Cassian continued. “It does not allow him to stay still in his cell or to devote any effort to reading.” His followers were not beset by desert heat or self-imposed isolation. They lived amidst one another, with communal values and shared tasks, in the relative comfort of an enclosed monastery in the south of France. Yet their attention wandered, their spiritual pursuits constantly frustrated by a dull dissatisfaction with the ordinary, the familiar, the interminable tasks of everyday life. Their work was divided between physical tasks and mental demands. Concentration became a virtue of the elite, the disciplined, and the holy, while distraction signaled the sick, the lazy, and the weak-willed.</p><p>Through the first millennium, Cassian’s acedia evolved into many different forms, notably becoming pathologized, exorcised of its demonic undertones, during the Renaissance. It became <i>melancholia</i>, the excess of black bile, the bilious byproduct of overworked scholars and frustrated alchemists, and, when made visible, an elitist expression of unbridled genius and tortured creativity. But has the illness been eradicated? How long does the demon reign?</p><p>In 2010, two scientists at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health published a study that found, based on the responses to a 1980s questionnaire of London civil servants, that “those who report being bored are more likely to die younger than those who are not bored.” Perhaps they were also right to conclude that “the state of boredom is almost certainly a proxy for other risk factors,” a gateway mood to self-destructive behaviors and unhealthy habits. But perhaps boredom is more maddening than madness. It’s what makes us cry out for something to rekindle our belabored minds. In a single turn, fever becomes our guardian. It is the violent storm breaking doldrums’ spell. And it is good.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">♠</p><p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>TWO</strong></p><p>When I was small I went to church every Sunday. It was a late Mass, comparatively, starting at 10:30 am, and yet we always seemed to be late. Hair ties askew and Mary Janes unbuckled, we’d slink into the nave amid the opening hymn, nudging through the pews to where my grandmother had saved us a spot, knowing we’d arrive at some point. She needed to save a spot: the services were fuller then.</p><p>I never minded the songs and readings; the homilies usually held my attention. But it was barely 11:00 when the priest tucked his notes back into his robes and descended from the lectern. Forty-five minutes remained (this Mass was late but long): forty-five minutes that, every Sunday, were inexorably the same. Preparation of the Gifts; Prayer over the Gifts; Preface Dialogue; the Holies and Acclamations and Prayers. I knew exactly what was coming and exactly how long it would take to get there — an excruciating knowledge when trapped within a pew. I usually hadn’t eaten anything, so there was also that wide, gaping ache of morning hunger, freezing my circulation before it made it to my fingers and toes. The incense made me woozy as the congregation muttered together, words whose cadence I could mimic but whose meaning I could only guess at until, later, I would see the prayers themselves written out in confirmation class. Time unrolled like a thick skein of yarn, caught in its own snags. I was endlessly, mindlessly bored.</p><p>In a certain sense, of course, this was the point. There is a relief in ritual, a comfort in repetition. Amid the cacophony of modern life, to chant is to withdraw, seeking solace detached from thought.</p><p>Boredom, then, succeeds at this precise detachment. In the medieval period, professor Stephen Greenblatt tells us in <i>The Swerve, </i>monasteries occupied an uncertain position: they were the repositories of knowledge, the copiers of ancient texts, but also the champions of a precise catechism that left little room for intellectual questioning. Monks were meant to copy down manuscripts letter by letter, without thinking, without debating the terms of ancient thought. The rooms were always silent but for the scratching of their quills. Inevitably, then, the monks would slip into lethargy. Quite simply, they were bored. Priests in charge called this the “noonday demon,” an acedia springing precisely from the prayerful reading to which the monks were meant to subscribe. Here in the monasteries, holy contemplation could easily become mechanical boredom; the difference between the two was indeed negligible.</p><p>We’ve become very good at negating the need to think about this distinction. “Prayerful reading” in a secular age has detached itself, to a certain extent, from the confines of medieval cloisters, finding its way into meditation and self-help rather than into the rituals of a Mass. Boredom has, some might say, been similarly banished. We have lost one of our country’s most fervent surveyors of this phenomenon in the death of David Foster Wallace, who as a child watched six hours of television per day. “Not just Muzak in dull or tedious places anymore,” he wrote in his unfinished <i>The Pale King, </i>“but now also actual TV in waiting rooms, supermarkets’ checkouts, airports’ gates, SUVs’ backseats. Walkmen, iPods, BlackBerries, cell phones that attach to your head.” People seek stimulation, Wallace suggests, to distract them from a deeper kind of pain than “dullness.” We have, he claimed — because he saw it in himself — a profound fear of silence, of shutting out the noise. Because perhaps once we do the reality of things will rear its terrifying head, and we will have to face whatever it is that the clamor drowns out.</p><p>What if boredom becomes necessary, though — impossible to escape? In some ways <i>The Pale King </i>is an attempt to follow this proposition to its the logical conclusions. In the stale monotony of the Midwestern IRS, its employees seem to want to go crazy but somehow cannot. Lane Dean pictures himself running around during his ten-minute break with ten cigarettes in his mouth, speaking in tongues, waving his hands; but he spends the break sitting, facing the clock, counting the seconds until he goes back to work. One whole chapter is composed of characters turning the page (literally: “She turned the page. He turned the page.” Pages and pages of this.).</p><p>But there is, Wallace seems to suggest, a certain nobility in what the IRS employees must achieve. “To function effectively in an environment that precludes everything vital and human. To breathe, so to speak, without air.” If you can become comfortable with boredom, live with it, you will, according to Wallace, be alright. As he said in his famous Kenyon commencement address, it is this embrace of boredom, the unsexy embrace of awareness in the everyday (<i>this is water—this is water)</i>, that makes getting through each moment possible, and worth it.</p><p>To strip down the noise, to face the threat lurking under boredom’s surface, and to emerge on the other side: These become the pillars of a new kind of catechism. It is a catechism that embraces boredom both in its superficial dullness and its existential despair. Boredom, when used correctly, becomes not a detractor from meaning but a prerequisite for the same. As scholar Michael Raposa has written, it is a metaphorical midwife: the “pallid half-darkness that sometimes lingers” before the dawning of the light. Boredom is thus elevated to a spiritual plane, one embedded in the <i>The Pale King</i>’s prose — even if Wallace himself ultimately couldn’t subscribe to the framework he so articulately mapped out.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">♣</p><p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>THREE</strong></p><p>Jørgen Leth and Ole John’s film <i>66 Scenes from America</i>, created in 1981, includes a “tableau” called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejr9KBQzQPM"" target=""_blank"">“Burger, New York.”</a> Seated at a long, black table in front of a dull, gray wall, Andy Warhol removes a Burger King Whopper box from its paper bag, opens it, unwraps the burger, and briefly struggles with getting ketchup out of a glass bottle of Heinz onto the wrapper (“It doesn’t come out,” he mutters). Warhol then proceeds to eat the hamburger, dipping it into the ketchup every so often; halfway through the 4’30” minute scene, he removes the top of the bun and folds the rest of the burger in half, and after four more bites Warhol puts it down. He wipes his mouth and tidies up, and after close to a minute of silence, says to the camera: “Uh, my name is Andy Warhol and, uh, I just finished eating uh, a hamburger.”</p><p>Watching the king of pop do anything on television is, at first, amusing. That’s the point. We watch the most mundane task all the way through because the artist has attained a celebrity status. There’s an element of absurdity, too, that Leth, John and Warhol would take on such a filmic production. And perhaps something grotesque about it as well, a kind of cannibalism — the “consumer artist” consuming one of the most prevalent consumer products. On top of this, the camera digests this scene for the audience’s viewing pleasure. If “cannibalism” is too strong a word, then we might at least agree on “oversaturation”: Warhol the icon represents the American individual steeped in — better yet, soaked through by — the commercial market.</p><p>It is, ironically, this oversaturation that produces the boredom that we eventually feel, that we see Warhol feeling, that permeates the long, black table and the dull, gray wall. The commercial world’s assault on the consumer, originally a source of stimulation, distraction, temptation, satisfaction, results in numbness. We are bored of this bombardment and yet continue to go through the motions, conditioned, like Pavlov’s dog, to salivate whenever we see the phrase “I’m lovin’ it” — a phrase forever linked to the crunch of a golden chicken nugget.</p><p>Warhol eats, but he does not <i>enjoy</i> what he eats; his chewing is accompanied by a deadpan stare. If his boredom wasn’t apparent before, it clearly shows when he takes half the bun off the hamburger, wanting to finish as quickly as possible. We realize suddenly that Warhol’s final statement is slightly, but crucially, untrue. He says, “I just finished eating, uh, a hamburger,” but there are several bites that he leaves on his wrapper, which he crumples up and throws away. He doesn’t finish the hamburger; what he means to say is that he’s finished <i>with</i> the hamburger. Warhol’s boredom verges on disgust and results in waste.</p><p>The metaphor of the consumer is apt because, just as we can get full from food, we can feel overloaded by brands and advertisements. We might call it “oversatisfaction” — the nauseating or soporific sensation of the “food coma” is akin to the glaze that comes over one’s eyes while looking through the tabloids at the grocery store. “Burger, New York” hints at the former but depicts the latter: The reason Warhol doesn’t finish the burger isn’t that he’s physically full; rather, he’s put off by the idea of continuing on, of consummating the act of utter non-satisfaction. This is not yet disgust, for disgust would be real emotion, outside boredom’s realm. Instead, Warhol’s nausea triggers the question, “Should I finish this hamburger?”, the answer being another question, “Do I care?”</p><p>The only glimmer of personality shows toward the beginning of the scene, when Warhol shakes the bottle of Heinz, muttering, “It doesn’t come out.” This frustration, though, is coupled with a wry grin from the artist, as if he’s glad to be shaken from his doldrums. Dissatisfaction is a flicker of life, an ironic pleasure quickly smothered by more concentrated boredom.</p><p>From oversaturation to non-satisfaction we come full-circle. I’m reminded of a piece of panda trivia I learned from a zookeeper at the San Diego Zoo: She said, in effect, that a panda excretes what it eats. To be clear: Its waste is literally a heap of chewed-up bamboo. In essence, the act of consumption is the only thing that distinguishes a panda’s food from its shit. Content to pulverize bamboo for what little nutrition it provides and to sleep, energyless and alone, for the rest of the day, pandas are probably one of the most bored creatures on the planet. We, too, wait for the next meal, following Warhol’s lead, his face stretched like cellophane, his hair bleached into oblivion.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">♥</p><p style=""text-align:center;""><strong>FOUR</strong></p><p>Rather than reflect on Facebook’s monopolization of contemporary boredom, as I was initially inclined to do, I’d like to look back at boredom’s pre-digital manifestations. Two historical prototypes capture my interest, each gendered, and both ripe for what Heidegger called a “confrontation with time”: the male soldier and the domestic female.</p><p>In her recently published book, <i>Modernism, Feminism, and the Culture of Boredom</i>, Allison Pease suggests that much of literary modernism was essentially shaped by female boredom. She claims that illustrating bored women characters was a way for writers of the early 1900s, like Woolf, Richardson and Sinclair, to voice their discontent with a suffocating gender-hierarchy. Female boredom was a very real phenomenon, instigated by very real societal subordination; to depict it in fiction, Pease argues, was a form of political dissent.</p><p>While literature from the early twentieth century presented a feminine species of boredom, a masculine species thrived elsewhere. In <i>Enduring Military Boredom: From 1750 to the Present</i>, Bard Maeland and Paul Otto Brunstad verify via historical case study the cheeky factoid that military service is 99% boredom and 1% terror. The book reveals that boredom did not belong to the ottoman alone; the vacuous sentiment haunted many a soldier waiting in a trench for his next employment or undergoing a long journey via submarine.</p><p>A condition of the same name afflicted he who represented his nation and she who was denied the right to take part in it. Boredom in these histories is no negative vacuum; rather, it is embedded within politics and lies at the heart of war and the family structure.</p><p>In the late nineteenth century, greater access to education had provided women with the intellectual means to succeed, but political and social constraints prevented them from so doing. Pease suggests that it was this growing tension between a woman’s internal self-realization and her steady external repression that resulted in boredom. Not only were women forced to remain inactive, Pease further proposes, but they willingly submitted themselves to recumbence as a form of respite: In <i>The Pastor’s Wife</i>, Elizabeth von Armin writes, “Ingeborg’s mother had found the sofa as other people find salvation …. she had simply discovered in it a refuge.” Along these lines, Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel diagnoses pathological boredom as the state that arises when a “subject seeks to be freed by means of a <i>passive</i> experience from a tension which set in because he was afraid of his own <i>active</i> impulses.” A woman’s energy was directed into passive boredom when her inner desire to act was unsatisfied by the outside world.</p><p>Not unlike the housewife, the soldier is appointed a specific social place. War suspends his agency, donning him responsibility and purpose. But not always is his purpose called to task: While the soldier is often busy, he is also often not. In a sketch of Private John Ball waiting for the Battle of the Somme, David Jones writes: “a penetrating tedium, a boredom that leadened and oppressed, making the spirit quail and tire, took hold of them, as they went to their first fatigue.” The image of the bored soldier is striking: One assumes, wrongly, that the meaningful title of <i>soldier</i> immunizes its beholder from feelings of listlessness. As Maeland and Brunstad report, consigned young men found the reality likewise striking. While one young man, for example, sought “the tickle of being close to death in order to combat his existential emptiness and boredom,” he soon discovered the same boredom in the trenches where he awaited that deathly tickle.</p><p>For both the female domestic and the male combatant, boredom, even when engendered of specific circumstance, bore existential consequence. Reinhard Kuhn says chillingly of the housewife’s ennui that “this is a condition that has no foreseeable or inevitable end but death.” The connection to the soldier here — whose boredom is literally broken by deathly engagement — is clear. Leonard Woolf suggests moreover that the soldier’s waiting would not be cured by the resumption of action, insofar as the act of waiting simply revealed the “negative emptiness and desolation of personal and cosmic boredom” that characterized the war in totality. In this vision, boredom is not a temporary sentiment, but rather a pathological state that alludes to life’s conclusive stillness.</p><p>While boredom may remind us of the end, however, it need not itself <i>be</i> the end. Indeed, boredom is often conceived of as a progenitor of creativity. In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, “Boredom is not an end-product, is comparatively rather an early stage in life and art. You’ve got to go by or past or through boredom, as through a filter, before the clear product emerges.” For Virginia Woolf and May Sinclair, Fitzgerald’s words ring true. And even the soldier was known to have creative breakthroughs, though his measures were often desperate. I will end with a section from Paul Fussell’s <i>In The Great War and Modern Memory</i> that illustrates one such creative breakthrough. The episode, which depicts an American POW in a German Stalag, is both familiar and alien; it calls to mind how universal and recognizable boredom is, how contagious it can be, and how curious are its expressions:</p><p> “[He] counted the barbs in one section of the barbed wire fence and then estimated the total number of barbs around the encampment. When he announced this number, his fellow kriegies not only didn’t consider him mad, they formed teams to check him out with a barb-by-barb count.”</p>","2013-4-5","[539, 17, 291, 536, 315, 448, 551, 560, 443, 674, 426, 77, 591, 165, 409, 431, 518, 419, 739, 88, 389, 356, 614, 281, 272, 179, 64]"

That same year, British philosopher Nick Bostrom carried <i>The Matrix</i>‘s threat out of movie theaters and into philosophy departments, publishing “Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?” Looking at the past growth of computing power, Bostrom raises the possibility that we are living in a simulated universe generated by an extremely powerful computer, which in turn might itself exist within yet another simulation, ad infinitum and ad nauseum. This skeptical worry along with a few related variations have come to be known as “simulation arguments.”</p><p><span id=""more-1167""></span></p><p>Philosophers often compare Bostrom to Descartes, arguing that the simulation argument is simply the dream argument — “Are we living in a dream?” — outfitted in the silicon trappings of the computer age. The similarity, certainly, is difficult to overlook. In a similar vein, we can view Dan Ashwood’s <i>Repeat Viewings</i> as a nineties-era refashioning of Bostrom’s skeptical worry. RV records the simulation argument with a camcorder and plays the tape over and over again until the video itself becomes damaged by the VCR. The acts of re-collection, re-membering, and re-vision are themselves caustic, slowly corroding what they attempt to preserve. In Ashwood’s animation, the anxiety underlying Bostrom’s simulation argument deteriorates and falls away. The characters’ existential angst lies not in the fact that they live in a simulated reality, but rather in a general question of nostalgia: Is it worth satisfying? Is our wistful affection for the past an act of violence that we should avoid? Or are the lines of static that gradually obfuscate our favorite videos like green lines of code, shimmering with the promise of meaning?</p>","2013-9-20","[603, 197, 738, 596, 684, 535, 557, 260, 409, 275, 622, 519, 27, 476]"
"Translation and Robert Musil","[16]","11","Kevin Stone ’13","<p>The translator’s preface is a curious genre.  I learned this as I studied it this fall for a translation project of my own, a translation of Austrian modernist Robert Musil’s novella <i>Die Vollendung der Liebe</i>.  Although the translator’s preface is not as well-recognized as the sonnet or the sestina, it has a fixed form.  First, the translator introduces the life of the author, often writing paeans to the author’s brilliance—which in reality justifies the <i>translator’s</i> present work.  With this bit of sorcery, the translation borrows the radiance of the original work, like a moon reflecting a sun without producing any light of its own, and the translator’s preface can avoid the real question: what necessitates the translation itself, as an original work?  The next part of the preface shows how the translator tried her best to polish the translation into a perfect mirror reflecting back all the light of the original; but because of the laws of optics, some of the light incident upon that mirror, inevitably, was lost.  The translator can then, in the final section, declare the discovery of a fourth law of thermodynamics: translation is failure, an irreversible process that loses a little bit of the original’s energy in every word of the new work.  And so, ultimately, what began as a justification becomes an apology for the very existence of translation.</p><p>But why not begin with this law of translation as failure as a premise, and build up a commentary from there, instead of deducing the same old law from new evidence?  In this process, it might be possible to justify a new work of translation with appeals to its internal logic and necessity rather than only those of the original.</p><p><span id=""more-442""></span></p><p>So, let me start with the axiom: all translation is failure.  That is, all translation is a failure to perfectly transmit all of the qualities of the original.  With that in mind, what justifies a new translation?  Allow me to borrow a concept from Robert Musil’s <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, his masterpiece.  In a famous chapter of this enormous work, Musil introduces the notion of “essayism” through Ulrich, the main character of the novel.  Borrowing largely from Nietzsche, Musil writes the following (in translation, of course, by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike):</p><p>The accepted translation of “essay” as “attempt” contains only vaguely the essential allusion to the literary model, for an essay is not a provisional or incidental expression of a conviction capable of being elevated to a truth under more favorable conditions or of being exposed as an error…; an essay is rather the unique and unalterable form assumed by a man’s inner life in a decisive thought.</p><p>Musil’s definition of essayism refers to translation’s failure to fully capture the meaning of the word “essay.”  And yet, Musil does not rail against translation itself but rather against “accepted translation.”  The problem is not with translation’s failure to capture meaning but rather with the failure of a single, fixed translation to capture completely “the unique and unalterable form assumed by a man’s inner life in a decisive thought” in the original work.  In that sense, every new translation can be understood as this type of essay.  If no one translation can contain the “decisive thought” of the original, each one can serve as both an “attempt” and as a “decisive thought” in itself.</p><p>In the same chapter of <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, Musil calls for an understanding of norms, ideals, and so-called truth “as a mobile equilibrium that at every moment requires continual efforts at renewal.”  Perhaps that is how we should understand the relationship between the “truth” of the original text and its versions in the target language.  Each of those versions is one of those one of those attempts, one of those “efforts at renewal” in our understanding of the original text.  And so translation gains an inner necessity of its own, one related to the original text but not necessarily contingent upon it.  There is no fixed, essential truth of the original text in the first place that a translation can aim to transmit.  There is only this “mobile equilibrium.”  In renewing our understanding of the original text, translations maintain this mobile equilibrium.  In other words, the “truth” of the original text requires the translations every bit as much as these require the original.</p><p>The imperfect act of translation itself can be seen, then, as an essay, an attempt—but the original question was how to justify a particular work of translation.  Ulrich, the main character of <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, considers life “a vast experimental station for trying out the best ways of being a man and discovering new ones.”  Perhaps a translation can serve as one of these experiments for figuring out the best ways to render a text, a “decisive thought.”  Each of these experiments will have different parameters and different hypotheses about their results, and some of the experiments will be better conceived and achieved than others.  While translation may maintain and renew the truth of the original text, to justify any individual translation requires that the translator lay out the parameters of her experiment.  That way, it can be judged on its own inner light and not on light borrowed from the original text.</p><p>All translations are indeed failures.  But this failure is a matter of goals.  If the goal of translation is to create the perfect mirror of the original text, this failure is discouragingly absolute.  The laws of thermodynamics are universal; in any real process of translation, there will always be a loss of information.  The only text that contains all of the information of the original text, after all, is the original text.  But if instead the goal of translation is to make an essay, an attempt, an experiment, then failure is simply part of the goal. Some translations are certainly better and more successful than others.  But all translations can do their part in maintaining the “mobile equilibrium” of truth that Musil describes.  If a translation is not a successful experiment, it can at least be an interesting failure.</p>","2012-12-21","[516, 657, 498, 659, 693, 400]"
